Clove Garden strongly supports the copyright protections that 
apply to creators of artistic and literary content. All material on the 
clovegarden.com site is copyrighted by someone unless specifically 
flagged as "Public Domain" or "Copyright Expired". Even in such cases 
there are rules against claiming it as your own.</span></p>
<p><span class=bg>We also believe in the doctrine of "Fair Use" as 
defined by U.S. copyright law and the courts. We apply a fairly liberal 
interpretation when material is used for strictly educational purposes 
and credited to the source.</span>

<h2>General</h2>

<p><u>Disclaimer</u>: &nbsp; I am not a lawyer, do not play one on TV, nor 
pretend to be one on dates. Nothing here is to be, nor can be, considered 
legal advice. Anything I state here is derived from publicly available 
sources, including the <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/"><b>U.S. 
Copyright Office</b></a>. For a definitive reading consult a copyright 
attorney.</p>

<p><u>All</u> creative works are automatically copyrighted, and the 
copyright is automatically assigned to the creator(s), unless that 
copyright has been specifically assigned in writing to another entity. 
In the United States this was established in a case regarding sculpture, 
but the courts have held it applies to all forms of creative work. This 
automatic copyright is recognized by all signators of the Berne 
Convention (nearly the entire world).</p>

<p>Within the United States, registration of a copyright, or even use of 
the &copy; symbol or a copyright notice is not required for copyright 
protection. Within other Berne signators registration is not required, 
but some 20 countries do require a copyright notice. In the US, 
registration enables you to recover a statutory $150,000 per violation, 
while unregistered works can only recover actual damages.</p>

<p>The exception to the above is a "Work for Hire", where the work was 
created by a person or persons specifically hired to do that work, 
whether by hourly wages, salary or consulting fees. In such cases the 
copyright belongs to the entity that paid for it. For a work created 
outside such an arrangement, if sold, the copyright does not pass with 
the work unless so stated in writing by the original copyright holder.</p>

<p><b>The fact that something has been published on the Internet does 
not in any way relieve the requirements of copyright law.</b> Internet 
publication does not in any way imply "public domain" as some have 
claimed. If you violate copyright you will likely receive a "cease and 
desist" letter, and if you ignore that you may find yourself defending a 
lawsuit involving monetary penalties. You aren't likely to win, and in 
the United States, due to work by the music and motion picture people, 
as well as copyright holders like Getty Images, the penalties can be 
rather severe.</p>

<p>On the Internet, you may, in addition, be viciously attacked in blogs 
and in other forums and publications, leaving your reputation in tatters 
and you shunned by all.</p>

<p><b>Recipes</b> are a special case that has been defined by the courts 
and the copyright office. This recognizes the fact that all recipes are 
based on prior art and simple lists of things aren't copyrightable. 
More at <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-protect.html">
<b>Copyright</b></a>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The list of ingredients cannot be copyrighted. Original descriptions 
  and instructions on what to do with the ingredients that accompany the 
  list most certainly are - unless they express something that can't be 
  expressed any other way.</li>
<li>Translation of units of measure or translation into a different 
  language does not relieve this protection.</li>
<li>Substantial or significant changes in ingredients or quantities, and 
  original writing of descriptions, procedures or methods, make it a new 
  recipe not subject to the copyright conditions of the recipe it is based 
  on. It does, however, now carry it's own copyright conditions.</li>
<li>All recipes on this site have been redeveloped with copious changes 
  in ingredients, quantities, methods and descriptions - nothing is copied. 
  Most of our recipes have a bibliography reference to the source at the 
  bottom. We do not more directly credit them because the source may not 
  agree with the changes we have made.</li>  
</ul>

<h3>Clovegarden Copyright</h3>

<p>At the time of this writing the www.clovegarden.com site is under 
development. It was originaly expected it would become a commercial site, 
but this is now increasingly unlikely. A wide variety of educational 
material is presented here that may be linked to without charge. Should 
the site becomes commercial, this free content will remain accessible 
under the same terms. Terms of usage are as stated below for Text and 
Images.</p>

<h3>Commercial Usage</h3>

<p>Many pages and materials on this site say "Linking to and 
non-commercial use of this page permitted". In other words, anyone 
may link to these page for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial. 
Anyone may use the material for personal, non-commercial purpose. This 
section defines commercial usage.</p>
<ul>
<li>Commercial usage is by any entity that sells products, displays or 
publishes paid advertising or charges for access to any part of its 
content, facilities, products or services, whether on the Internet, at 
a physical facility or in any other way. This includes any site that 
effectively fronts for a commercial site or entity.</li>
<li>Linking to pages on this site from commercial sites is permitted 
unless the page specifically says otherwise (at this writing none do), 
provided no attempt is made to disguise the source or give the impression 
it is part of the linking site or that the linking site and Clovegarden 
are in any way associated. Frames are to be avoided.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Text</h3>
<ul>
<li>All text on this site is copyright Andrew Grygus dba Clovegarden 
  unless specifically stated otherwise within or adjacent to the text, 
  or which clearly belongs to some other entity. In general, there is a 
  copyright notice at the bottom of each page.</li>
<li>Text may be freely linked to from other sites provided it is properly 
  attributed to clovegarden.com and no attempt is made to conceal its 
  true attribution (frames, etc.).</li>
<li>Text may be copied without permission only to the extent of "Fair Use" 
  as defined by U.S. copyright laws and judicial decisions.</li>
<li>For inclusion in electronic or print media beyond the "Fair Use" 
  limits requires permission and may be subject to attribution, 
  conditions and/or monetary costs at Clovegarden's sole discretion.</li>
<li>Minor editing or translation into another language does not relieve 
  the conditions of copyright.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Images</h3>

<ul>
<li>All photographs, drawings and other images on the CloveGarden site are 
  copyrighted by someone unless specifically stated as contributed to the 
  "Public Domain" or "Copyright Expired". Specific 
  copyrights are listed below.</li>
<li id="cg1">All images listed as &copy; 
  <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/photos.html#cg1"><b>cg1</b></a> are licensed in 
  accordance with <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"> 
  <b>Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike v4.0 International</b></a>.  
  Attribution to www.clovegarden.com is no longer required, but 
  notification of such use is appreciated. &nbsp; <u>Note</u>: &nbsp; 
  Most of the images on this site are rather small. In most cases larger 
  versions are available on request. There may, or may not, be a small 
  charge for preparation and delivery, at our discretion. This will be 
  implemented only for use deemed commercial.</li>    
<li id="cg2">Any images listed as &copy; 
  <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/photos.html#cg2"><b>cg2</b></a> will be licensed only by 
  request under terms of agreement. At this time (2020) there are no such 
  images on the site.</li>
<li>Clove Garden applies reasonable effort to comply with all copyright 
  conditions. In a very few cases photographs may be used without 
  permission for some reason (usually difficulty contacting the source 
  of the image) but generally will include attribution and the phrase 
  "Permission Requested". If any are yours, please contact us to either 
  give permission or with any objections you may have.</li>
<li>In some cases we have "borrowed" product images from a commercial site 
  without permission, as we cannot determine whether the copyright belongs 
  to the site or to the product manufacturer. In such cases we always 
  provide a link to the source site, presuming this advertising is 
  sufficient reward for use of the image. Any objections will be 
  respected.</li>
<li id="none"><u>Please inquire</u> about Any images without a 
  copyright notice. If they are copyrighted by Andrew Grygus dba 
  Clovegarden they will probably be licensed according to "cg1", or 
  contact information for the actual copyright holder will be provided.
  </li>
<li>An <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/photos.html"><b>Image Copyrights</b></a> page is 
  available to define photos that are not &copy; cg1 or cg2 and don't 
  have copyright information with them on the page. Many of these will 
  have been purchased from iStockPhoto, BigStockPhoto or another stock 
  photo entity. Not all are posted there yet, but eventually will be.
