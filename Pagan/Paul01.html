<h1>Jesus Betrayed</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
<span class=tf>The real betrayal of Jesus was not by Judas, but by Paul.
</span></p>
<p>This is an opinion held by quite a few students of the New Testament.
Judas did what he was required to do, and suffered greatly for that. 
Jesus chose him as a disciple for the purpose. Surely the Son of God 
knew what Judas' acts would be.</p> 

<p>The teachings of Paul go directly against Jesus' teachings, and 
set the scene for an authoritarian church that has little to do with 
Jesus' actual teachings. Some go so far is to suggest Paul may have 
faked his conversion and infiltrated Christianity to corrupt it for 
his own purposes.</p> 

<p>James, brother of Jesus, wrote directly against Paul and his 
teachings, even using Paul's own words against him. Thomas Jefferson, 
who studied the Bible intensively, strongly questioned Paul's teachings. 
Perhaps the greatest philosopher of the 20th Century, Bertrand Russel, 
stated that the world would have been better off had "Paul never been 
born".</p>

<p>Note that in Christian iconography, the sword held by Paul symbolizes 
that he was martyred. It is thought he was beheaded in Rome by order of 
Nero, a little  before 68 CE.	Go Nero!

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This page is a side branch from our Christo-Pagan page, 
<a href="CrPagan01.html"><b>Jesus &amp; Paganism</b></a>, to explain 
how it came that the Christian Churches do not in any way represent 
Jesus or his teachings. It may be useful to many other thoughtful 
persons as well, to explain the reasons for what they can easily see.
</p>

<h2>Paul</h2>

<p>Paul was a short, bald man, but otherwise had some outstanding 
advantages in his life. He was a Jew, but had been born a Roman 
citizen. The details of his citizenship are unknown, but it gave 
him freedom to travel throughout the Roman Empire. He was well 
educated, a Pharisee, and held high status in the Jewish community.
</p>

<p>Paul, under his original name, Saul of Tarsus, was an aggressive 
persecutor of the followers of Jesus. On an expedition to Damascus 
for the purpose of bringing followers of Jesus back to Jerusalem 
for trial, his story is that he was converted by an apparition of 
Jesus. Either that, or he came up with a better idea on how to 
screw the followers of Jesus.</p>

<p>Paul's Epistles (letters to the churches) are not easy reading, 
because of his penchant for paragraph long sentences that are often 
wandering. His rehtoric seems deliberately tangled, as if trying to 
snow his audience with logic they cannot follow, thus reinforcing 
his image as a sophisticate. The material on Paul in Luke's Acts is 
clearly not first hand from Paul, as Luke's theology often does not 
match that stated in Paul's Epistles.</p>

<h2>Justification by Faith Alone</h2>

<p><img src="img/Cathars01k.jpg" alt="Cathars being expelled" class=mrg>
Perhaps the most damaging of Paul's teachings is the persistent 
assurance that one finds salvation <u>only</u> through faith, and 
this salvation does not depend on following the law, or not following 
the law, or how you treat your fellow man.</p>

<p>Paul formulated this renegade teaching immediately after his 
"conversion", or perhaps before, as he is already preaching salvation 
by belief alone in Acts XIII 39-41 &amp; subs.</p>

<p>This relieves the church and its "faithful" from any retribution 
from God, even for crimes against humanity, which the church and its 
"faithful" have engaged in rather freely. According to Paul, you need 
only believe in Jesus, and you're home free. Contrast this to Jesus 
teaching: the "Hell of Fire" awaits you.</p>

<p>Paul states this clearly in many places. For example, he asks 
rhetorically what kind of law and what kind of works would earn 
salvation? He answers that these will have no effect, but only faith. 
He concludes that man finds salvation by faith, completely apart 
from law and works (Romans III 27-28).</p>

<p>This is directly rebutted by James, brother of Jesus, who certainly 
knew a thing or two about Jesus' teachings (James II 24). "You see 
that by works a man is justified and not by faith alone."
<br class=cll></p>
<br>

<h2>The Law of Moses</h2>

<p><img src="img/Moses01k.jpg" alt="Moses with the Tablets" class=mrg>
Jesus not only supported the Laws of Moses (10 commandments), he 
even expanded on them. In the Sermon on the Mount, he warned not to 
imagine he came to destroy the law or the prophets - but to fulfill 
the laws and prophecy (Mat V 13-48, VI 1-8). He than goes through 
commandments and laws and interprets them far beyond the literal.</p>

<p>Paul has little use for the Law of Moses, or any other laws, and 
here extends his thesis of salvation by belief alone, no matter what. 
Paul says to deploy the members (of the church) as weapons of 
righteousness under God's will. Then their sins will not matter because 
they are not subject to the law, for they are under the grace of God 
(Rom VI 14).</p>

<p>Further, Paul states that God's righteousness has been shown by 
the law and the prophets. In the eyes of God there must be faith 
in Jesus Christ for all have sinned and fall short of God's standards 
(Rom III 21-26). See <a href="Paul01.html#orig"><b>Original Sin</b></a>. In other 
words, there is no distinction between the serial murderer and one who 
followed the laws, kept the Sabbath, and cared for the poor. Clearly 
then, there is no incentive to live an honest and charitable life. 
This attitude is lamentably prevalent among Christians, but is totally 
incompatible with the teachings of Jesus, and Jesus is the final 
judge. Lets hear it for the "Hell of Fire"!
<br class=cll></p>
<br>


<h2 id="orig">Original Sin</h2>

<p><img src="img/AdamEve01k.jpg" alt="Adam and Eve" class=mrg>

Original sin was a concept heavily promoted by Paul. It seems to have 
one Old Testament precedent in Psalm 51:5, though Adam and Eve aren't 
mentioned there. In Paul's system, it was essential that every person 
be steeped in sin so the ax murder and the Sunday school teacher had 
equal need for salvation by belief in Jesus. This guilt is from a sin 
committed by Adam and Eve, inescapable, not removed by baptism or good 
works, and more severe than any other sin - direct disobedience of God.
</p>

<p>Jesus makes no mention of original sin, and holds good works to 
be the path to salvation, belief or no.

<h2>Sins Washed Away in Blood of Jesus</h2>

<p><img src="img/Jesus05c.jpg" alt="Jesus on the Cross" class=mrg>
Paul taught that to achieve salvation one must be sinless, and, 
with <a href="Paul01.html#orig"><b>Original Sin</b></a> you have no hope of 
erasing your sins. So, Jesus died on the cross specifically to "wash 
away your sins" by his sacrifice. Absent sin, salvation can be achieved 
by faith alone. It is very difficult to make sense of this doctrine, 
but we need not even try. There is no mention by Jesus or anyone else 
in the Gospels that Jesus died on the cross to wash away your sins. 
This was all made up by Paul, and preached by Paul, and by Paul's 
followers in accordance with his doctrine, and by the Churches he 
founded. It was not preached by followers of the teachings of Jesus.
<p>

<p>Jesus taught that salvation came not from faith alone, but from 
repentance, and especially by good works and compassion, faith or no. 
His death on the cross was to fulfill prophecy, and had no bearing 
on your sins.
<br class=cll></p>
<br>

<h2>Suppression of Women</h2>

<p><img src="img/Marymag02c.jpg" alt="Repentant Mary Magdalene" class=mrg>
The churches have long suppressed the roll of women and their place in 
the church and in society. This is not from Jesus, who elevated women, 
and in the very early church women and men were treated almost equally. 
The suppression of women that they are rebelling against in our time 
comes directly from Pauline Christianity.</p>

<p>Paul despised women, and in his writings leaves no doubt. He states 
very firmly that woman should be silent in all assemblies of the 
faithful, and not be permitted to speak. He orders them to place 
themselves in obedience and subjugation, "as the law says" He further 
says that if a woman wants to learn things, they should ask their 
own husbands at home. He states firmly that it is disgraceful for a 
woman to speak in an assembly of the faithful. (1Cor XIV 33-34).</p>

<p>Paul demanded that women stay in the home, bearing children 
(preferably male), cooking, and cleaning. He states that, "after mature 
consideration", he urges younger widows to marry, bear children, and 
manage household affairs - avoiding idle hands that are the tools 
of the Devil, and claims some widows have already turned to Satan 
(1Tim V 14)."</p>

<p>Paul demanded that wives be constantly subjugating themselves 
with unquestioning obedience to their husbands in all things, as a 
man ought to do to the Lord. (Colos III 18) and (Ephes V 22-24). 
According to Paul, there's not much difference between a wife and 
a <a href="Paul01.html#slav">Slave</a>.</p>

<p>Jesus, on the other hand, elevated women to a degree very uncommon 
in his day. He even chastised a woman, Martha, for rushing around 
preparing food, while here sister Mary sat at his feet listening to 
his teachings. Martha complained to Jesus that he should send Mary 
to the kitchen. Jesus admonished her for being worried and excited 
about many things while few were needed or useful. He tells her that 
Mary chose the best course, that of listening to his teachings and 
should not be snatched away from them (Luke X 38-42).</p>

<p>It was probably under the influence of Paul that Mary Magdalene, a 
well to do woman who helped finance Jesus' mission from her own resources, 
was recast as a repentant prostitute.

<h2 id="slav">Slavery</h2>

<p><img src="img/slaves01c.jpg" alt="Slaves" class=mrg>
While Jesus never taught against slavery, he may have included 
slaves among the "least ones" and how they would be raised above the 
powerful in The Kingdom. Paul commands slaves that they must obey 
the master without question.</p>

<p>Paul demands that slaves put themselves in subjection to their 
masters with total obedience in all things. He says to give him 
satisfaction, not to cross him or pilfer his supplies, but to 
show total trustworthiness. (Tit II 9-10).</p>

<p>Paul tells slaves to be always obedient to their masters, "with 
fear and trembling" and holding them (the masters) in their hearts 
as they would the Christ, and serving the master as if doing the 
will of God, rendering service to the master as if to the Lord. 
(Eph VI 9-10)
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>The Church</h2>

<p><img src="img/HelLuthCh01k.jpg" alt="Helsinki Lutheran Cathedral" class=mrg>
Jesus was a traveling preacher with a small following of desciples 
who traveled with him. He met with small, informal congregations, mostly 
in peoples homes. His only mention of the word "church" was to say, of 
Simon, a simple fisherman, that he was the Rock [Petros, Peter], and 
on this massive rock he would build his Church. (Mat XVI 18). Jesus 
made no other ecclesiastical appointments whatever, and suggested no 
formal church structure.</p>

<p>Paul traveled throughout the Roman Empire, setting up a wide 
structure of interlinked churches, with an authoritarian clergy, 
and all devoted to a standardized doctrine, based not on the 
teachings of Jesus, but on his own teachings in contradiction 
to Jesus' teachings.</p>

<p> Nearly a third of the New Testament consists of Paul's letters 
aimed at maintaining control of the churches and promoting his 
standardized doctrine. In Paul's churches, Jesus was little more 
than a name. The churches of today are descended from Paul's churches, 
and do not represent Jesus in any way, they exploit him.

<h2 class=lrg>Disclaimer</h2>

<p><img src="img/Freya02e.jpg" alt="Freya" class=mrg>  I am not a 
Christo-Pagan - but I do know a lot about Paganism, and a lot about 
early Christianity. I have been a subscriber to Biblical Archaeology 
for several decades, and have done many other studies, including reading 
the Gospels all the way through.</p>
<p>I am a largely non-theist Pagan, but have recently been doing some 
work with Freya, who seems to be branching out from her Germanic roots 
- note her very India style pose and Japanese companion (Shinto I 
presume).</p>


<p>Due to time limitations for original research, I followed a number 
of suggestions by Davis D. Danizier, from his Web site and his book, 
<i>Betrayal of Jesus</i>. My reference for all material from the New 
Testament is the 1961 Kenneth S. Wuest translation from the Greek. I 
have rephrased for clarity (and copyright matters) but have provided 
gospel links so you can refer directly to the Gospel passages. 
I recommend the Wuest translation, but others will work too.</p> 

<p>I recommend against the King James Bible, which was composed under 
his orders to make it conform to the doctrines of the Church of England, 
and to his own obsession with hunting witches, which caused the deaths of 
thousands of innocent people, mostly women. I have no respect whatever 
for King James, and strong suspicion of his Bible.</p>
