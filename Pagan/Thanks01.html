<h1>Thanking <small>for</small> Sustenance</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p><span class=bg>
We are of the Earth and embedded within it, but we are of the Animal Kingdom, 
and have no choice but to sustain our lives at cost to other beings. Some 
foods are offered by plants as their means of propagating their kind, but most 
of our sustenance comes by taking the lives of other beings.</span></p> 

<p><span class=bg>Plants too have awareness, so even being Vegan doesn't get 
us off the hook. What we can do, and must do, is to be respectful and thankful 
for what we must take - it is the Pagan thing to do. Here below is a simple 
ritual that can be used at the dinner table or any other appropriate time. 
It can be voiced, or recited silently.</span></p>

<p><span class=bg>You should, while reciting your thanks, be visualizing the 
living beings that have provided the food that is before you. It is usually 
impossible to visualize them all during so short a ritual, but at least the 
major ones. This ritual is my own work, and I contribute it to the Public 
Domain.</span></p>

<p><span class=bg>If your mind wanders during the ritual, start over</span>

I give my blessing to this food in thanks
<br>To all the living beings that have brought it to me 
<br>That I may be healthy and strong. 
<br>That I may heal my wounds and continue my work.
<br>Again, I give my blessing and my thanks. 
<br>And hope to be worthy of blessing in turn.

<br>That we may heal our wounds and continue our work.
<br>Again, We give our blessings and our thanks.

<h3 class=lrg>Disclaimer</h3>

<p><img src="img/Freya02e.jpg" alt="Freya" class=mrg>
I am a largely Non-Theist Pagan, but have recently been doing some work 
with Freya, who seems to be branching out from her Germanic roots - 
note her very India style pose and Japanese companion (Shinto I presume). 
It's all OK, since Vedic Hinduism originated from the same Proto 
Indo-European root as Germanic Paganism.</p>
