<h1>Modern Spirituality</h1>
<hr class=hr2>

<p><span class=bg>In our time, the major religions controlling much of 
our world for over 2000 years seem increasingly worn out and dangerous. 
Some cultures increasingly recognize these religions as tools of 
opression. Many are looking for relief from less destructive spiritual 
practices of other cultures and other times. Of particularly interest 
are the practices of our own cultures from pre-Christian times. This 
page is devoted to exploring such possibilities.</span></p>
<p>We have a couple of articles on Neo-Paganism, but hope to have 
contributed articles on other non-destructive, ecologically aware 
spiritualities that have evolved significantly in the 20th and 21st 
centuries.

<a href="Pagan01.html"><h3>A Pagan Reality - In Our Time:</h3></a>
<p>This page presents religions and philosophies derived from those of 
the pre-Christian past of Europe. Some are careful reconstructions 
of past practices of particular people, that can become part of their 
national identity. Others are derived from rather loose and imaginative 
interpretations of the folk ways of the past.

<a href="CrPagan01.html"><h3>Jesus &amp; Paganism</h3></a>
<p>This page explores issues surrounding Christo-Paganism. It can be 
helpful for persons wishing to bring Jesus into the Pagan fold, and also 
helpful for Christian interested in the relationship of Christianity 
to Paganism.
