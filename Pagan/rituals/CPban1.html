<hr class=hr2>
<p>

<p>Christian Churches claim to represent Jesus, but don't, they 
<u>exploit</u> Jesus. They were founded by Paul, who exploited Jesus 
without mercy, and corrupting his teachings. James, brother of Jesus, 
who certainly should know, pointed this out very clearly, even during 
Paul's ministry. For details see our page 
<a href="../Paul01.html"><b>Jesus Betrayed</b></a>.</p>

<p>Many now reject the pervasive threats of eternal damnation, oppression, 
bigotry, and immorality of the Christian Churches, and many more will. 
Many wish simply to be free of the Church and its false teachings, 
joining the fast growing ranks of "Spiritual but not Religious". Others 
reject the Church, but fervently wish to remain with Jesus, and some 
of these wish even to take Jesus with them into the Pagan fold.</p>

<p>Some cast off the bindings of the Church easily, but others find that 
very hard to do. It is hoped this page will be helpful for them - and for 
those in between.

<h2>Overview</h2> 


<p>Teachings of the Christian Churches are simply incompatible with 
practically any other religion, forcing "all or nothing" obedience. 
This is not so for the actual teachings of Jesus, which emphasize 
good works and compassion even beyond faith. There is no mention of 
original sin, or of your sins being washed away in the blood of 
Jesus - not in the words of Jesus nor in the Gospels.</p>

<p>There are, as with any ancient religion, inconsistencies between 
the teachings of Jesus in his time and our world today. These must be 
resolved to follow his teachings honestly. We present a discussion 
of these inconsistencies on our page <a href="../CrPagan01.html">
<b>Jesus &amp; Paganism</b></a> - but the first order of business 
is to break the bonds that bind you to the Church.</p>

<p>These bonds were deliberately and skillfully placed to control you, 
and are not easy to break. To break them you must act with intent, 
and with strength.</p>

<p>Here we present a ritual which may be of great practical help in 
breaking the bonds. This ritual is a working of magic. It is magic of 
the most ethical and effective kind. It is designed not to control others, 
not to effect the physical world (very difficult to do magically), but 
to change yourself. Once you have performed the ritual, keep it in mind. 
Refer to it any time you feel weakness or uncertainty - and especially 
when others try to bring you back.</p>

<p>If you have chosen Paganism, you agree to be one with the Earth and 
its surrounding realms. As a Pagan you become a steward of the Earth, 
and all its creatures, not a dominator. You are entering a realm of many 
Gods and Goddesses, but may have chosen Jesus as your guide and protector. 
Even so, in time you may call upon other Gods as well, but not until you 
have studied them sufficiently to understand their nature.</p>

<p>The jealous, angry, vengeful God of the Old Testament has no place in 
Paganism, and should have no place among those who have broken from the 
Church. God/desses may accept worship, but no true God <u>demands</u> 
worship, nor threatens eternal flames for failure to worship. How much 
has this God done to protect his "Chosen People"? This God is a tool for 
repression and subjugation, convenient to the ambitions of priests, 
kings, emperors - and Churches.</p> 
<br>

<h2>Things you Need</h2> 

<p>You will need some things, but they are easy to acquire and not 
expensive.</p>

<ul>

<li><b>You:</b> &nbsp; By far the most important item in this ritual 
  your intent, and your determination to express that intent.
  <p></p></li>

<li><b>Wand:</b> &nbsp; The wand represents fire, action, and will - 
  <u>your</u> will and <u>your</u> action. It need be no more than a 
  natural stick that strikes your fancy, or something you made. You 
  could buy a wand made by a crafts person, if the cost is not an issue. 
  The magic is   not in the wand, the magic is within you, the wand is 
  a symbolic expression of your magic.<p></p></li>
  
<li><b>Black Candle:</b> &nbsp; Black votive candles and 4 inch 
  mini ritual candles are available inexpensively. Provide also a 
  safe holder for the candle so it can be allowed to burn out 
  completely without attention.<p></p></li>

<li><b>Matches:</b> &nbsp; Don't forget them! You will need them to 
  light the candle.<p></p></li>

<li><b>Paper &amp; Pen:</b> &nbsp;  You need to do a little writing. 
  The paper need not be fancy, it is going to be burned. Of course, 
  it would be particularly nice if it were the back side of a piece cut 
  from some publication of the church in question, with the church's 
  name on it, but plain blank paper will be fine.<p></p></li>

<li><b>Receptacle:</b> &nbsp;	Some non-flammable container in which 
  to safely place a burning piece of paper.<p></p></li>

<li><b>A Private Place:</b> &nbsp; You need to set up a place, a surface, 
  where you can perform this ritual without distraction or interruption.  
  A place where you can be seated comfortably, or stand comfortably if you 
  prefer. IF you have set up an altar dedicated to Jesus, that is 
  <u>not</u> the place to perform a banishing ritual. Arrange some other 
  place.<p></p></li>

<li><b>A Mantra:</b> &nbsp; This mantra should be specific to this 
  working. See <a href="CPban1.html#mantra"><b>Mantras</b></a> below for examples. 
  You can use one of them, or you can compose your own. You can have it 
  written down for reference during the ritual, but do so in 
  your own handwriting.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Preparation</h2>

<p>Be ready. Understand the ritual and the order in which it is to be 
performed. Note any changes you make from what is given here. Review 
it as many times as you need to. Realize the seriousness of the act 
your are about to engage in. The steps given here are very basic 
to any effective ritual, not just this one.</p>

<p>The first step is to make the ritual space clean and orderly. This 
declares to both yourself, to Jesus, or to any other Gods, Goddesses, 
or spirits you intend to call upon, that you are serious in this 
endeavor.</p>

<p>Set up the ritual space with all the objects you will need. Think 
about it - there must be no running around looking for things during 
the ritual. Take note also of the compass directions. You need to 
know four cardinal directions.</p>

<p>When the time comes, bathe yourself. Dress in loose, comfortable 
clothing. Comb or brush you hair, but apply no makeup or perfumes. 
Approach the ritual space calmly and thoughtfully.</p>

<h2>The Working</h2>

<p>You will first be casting a circle. Lacking dedicated temples in our 
time, this is the way we define our sacred space. If your space is roomy 
enough, you may walk around the ritual table as you cast the circle.</p> 

<ul>
<li>Pick up your wand and use it to project your energy. Standing, 
  muster your intent, point the wand around <u>clockwise</u> to define 
  a circle surrounding both yourself and the ritual table, not too close. 
  Draw the circle twice, or as many times as you need to feel your 
  strength.<p></p></li>

<li>Face East and address the spirits of the East, thanking them for 
being present and for the protection of your space. Similarly address 
the spirits of the South, then the West and the North.<p></p></li>

<li>Sit or stand before your ritual table, as you have chosen, in quiet 
  contemplation - until you feel ready. Place your wand crosswise in 
  front of the candle.<p></p></li>

<li>Recite the mantra for the working. Remain in silence for a few 
  moments. Then, holding strongly to your purpose, light the Black 
  Candle. Watch its flame take hold, continuing to hold to your intent.
  <p></p></li>

<li>When you feel ready, recite the mantra again, with feeling. Now, 
  take the Paper you have provided and write your intent to break free 
  from the Church. Name the church, and declare all other churches as 
  well. Fold the paper into an elongated shape, with your message 
  turned inward. Spend a few moments in contemplation. 
  <p></p></li>

<li>Repeat the mantra again with feeling and determination. Light the 
  paper from the candle. Hold it as long as you safely can, thinking 
  about your intent. Then drop it into the safe, fireproof place you 
  have provided, and let it burn out.<p></p></li>

<li>Sit in contemplation of the candle flame as long as you feel it is 
  needed.<p></p></li> 

<li>When ready, rise and close the circle. Holding your wand, but not 
  pointing it, Face East, thank the spirits of the East for their 
  attendance, and dismiss them politely. Then go around 
  counter-clockwise to the North, and to the West, and the South 
  doing the same.<p></p></li>

<li>You may now declare the circle closed, and step out of it. Leave the 
  Black Candle to burn out completely. Later, when ready, take the ashes 
  of the paper and return them to the Earth, contemplating what you 
  have done.</li>
  </ul>

<h2 id="mantra">Mantras for the Ritual</h2>

<p>These mantras are composed as examples, which you may use as is, 
or which you may modify to be more meaningful to you, or to better 
suit your exact intent. If you wish, you can make up your own mantra 
entirely, if it will be more meaningful to you and to your personal 
magic. Give this your thoughts. Magic is intensely personal.</p>

<h3>Leaving the Church for Jesus</h3>

<p>This mantra is composed for persons who wish freedom from the Church, 
but alignment with Jesus as their sponsor.</p>

<p>Jesus, you who are the Christ, please be with me. 
<br>Be with me as I cast off the bindings of the Church. 
<br>The Church of the Demon Paul.
<br>The Church that has so distorted your teachings.
<br>Be with me and guide me through this work, as I join your fold.
<br>So let it be.
</p>

<h3>Leaving the Church for Other Deities</h3>

<p>This mantra is composed for a person who wishes to dedicate to 
a particular God or Goddess. This can be plural for a pantheon. It is 
presumed you have studied the chosen deity(s) sufficiently to know 
how to address them. Here it is written for dedication to the Goddess 
Freya.</p>

<p>Freya, sorceress, warrior goddess, protector of love, beauty and 
  fertility, please be with me.
<br>Be with me as I cast off the bindings of the Church.
<br>As I cast off the Church of the Demon Paul.
<br>The Church of deception, bigotry and oppression.  
<br>Be with me and guide me through this work, and welcome me into 
  your fold.
<br>So let it be.
</p>

<h3>Leaving the Church as a Non-Theist Pagan</h3>

<p>Non-Theists and even Atheists are major groups amongst the Pagans, 
and they hold a myriad of attitudes and beliefs. For some, this mantra 
will need significant change, but for many it will be suitable.</p>

<p>Here I declare my oneness with the Earth, and with all its spirits, 
living, material, and ethereal.
<br>I ask all the spirits of the Earth to be with me as I cast off the 
  bindings of the Church. 
<br>The Church of the Demon Paul.
<br>The Church of deception, bigotry, and oppression.
<br>Be with me and guide me through this work, and welcome me into 
  your fold.
<br>So let it be.

</p><hr class=hr2>
<br>

<h2>Defense</h2>

<p>You will be approached by family, friends, and complete strangers 
who are sure they can bring you back into the bindings of the Church, 
and to "salvation". They may be pretty insistent about it, too. You 
will have to resist them, or sacrifice your own integrity.</p>

<p>I read comments by a lady who was brought up a Jehovah's Witness, 
and worked in China proselytizing for the Church. She began to suspect 
that some things were just not at all right, but the bindings were 
extremely strong - they were all she knew. Her marriage was not working 
either, and her husband told her flat out he did not love her, but 
divorce is unthinkable in that church. Marriage is forever, even though 
Jesus clearly stated that all marriage bonds are void in the kingdom of 
heaven.</p>

<p>On-line, she met a man who needed help learning the Mandarin language. 
They became on-line friends, even though she knew that a friendship with 
a man other than her husband was considered sinful. He looked up things 
about mind control and discussed them with her.</p>

<p>It came that she made a trip to the United States, a trip that landed 
in Los Angeles. She had arranged to meet this man in person. She said it 
was not in the least desired, planned or expected - but it just went off 
like clockwork. She committed adultery, an absolutely unthinkable sin 
within the the Jehovah's Witness community. It was a sin so unthinkably 
severe it shattered all the bonds of the church, and she was free.</p>

<p>So, after completing this ritual, when people try to convert you back, 
just tell them, sadly, that you have committed a sin so severe there is 
no hope for you, and your presence would only corrupt their church. 
Following the teachings of Paul, they will tell you faith alone will 
forgive all sins, even original sin.</p>

<p>Tell them, no, there are sins so severe they cannot be forgiven by 
faith, because they erase all desire for faith. You will go to the 
hereafter holding your good works and compassion, as Jesus taught.</p> 

<p>The religion of ancient Egypt, at the birth of Christianity was 
already 1000 years older than Christianity is today. The Egyptians 
held that upon death you faced judgement. Your heart was weighed against 
the feather of Maat (Justice). You are judged on how well you played the 
cards life dealt you, peasant or king. While not usually as clear, 
this is the attitude of most religions, other than the Church of Paul, 
and Jesus would agree, for it is in his teachings.</p>

<p>No, the Egyptian religion did not fade because of the superiority of 
Christianity, it ended by decrees of emperors, starting with Constantine 
II, and by roving mobs of Christians bent on murder and destruction of  
temples. Paganism held on for over 400 years, until emperors decreed 
death for anyone holding to Pagan beliefs, even in the privacy of their 
homes, and enforced those decrees.</p>
