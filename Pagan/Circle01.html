<h1>Defining Sacred Space</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p><span class=bg>
Most modern Pagans have a sort of nomadic approach to Sacred Space. The 
great temples of the Old World were destroyed by the bloody imposition of 
Christianity. Few will be built today, and none on that scale. Our world is 
different from then, and we are often on the move, like the Gypsys of old. 
We must make our Sacred Space where we need it and when we need it, and will 
often take it down when we are done.</span>

<h2>Sacred Places</h2>

<p><img src="img/pg_Stonehenge01h.jpg" alt="Stonehenge, England" class=mrg>
Many Sacred Places of ancient times are still noted for being sacred, 
and need no castings or such to make them sacred. Many people travel to 
such places for special needs, or to commune with spirits, deities and 
ancestors. These places have so served for thousands of years, and 
through many cultures. Their sacredness can often be felt as well by 
persons who are not Pagans.</p>

<p>Some have monuments built by humans, but many are natural places with 
as little human contribution as possible. The most famous Sacred Space in the 
Western World is Stonehenge, in England. Modern Druids like to hold ceremonies 
there, and the ancient Druids probably held it as a sacred place as well, but 
it was sacred for thousands of years before the ancient Druids appeared. It 
was built by a people almost nothing is known about, except they were very 
good at astronomical mathematics, and at moving rocks - and that they very 
much valued Sacred Space.</p>

<h2>Temples</h2>

<p><img src="img/pg_Garni01k.jpg" alt="Temple at Garni, Armenia" class=mrg>
Temples are powerful Sacred Places purposely erected by a people. The 
Pagan temples of Europe and the Near East were many, widespread, and of 
diverse construction. Christians feared them and destroyed them all, 
slaughtering many of those who had used them. They were thorough, leaving 
little for the Muslims to destroy.</p>
 
Temples will not be rebuilt on anything like the scale of ancient times - 
today there is little financial basis for it. In Italy and Greece a number 
of Temples have recently been built, but, while substantial, they have been 
the projects of individuals. Even the Christians are now having a hard 
time maintaining their churches (Christian temples). Their parishioners are 
loosing the Fear of Hell, and don't see the need to pay their way out of 
it. Pagans offer no threats, and make no attempt at such extortion.</p>

<p>In the ancient world, statues and symbols within the temples served as 
portals for communication with the deities or spirits to whom they were 
dedicated. The classical temples of the Mediterranean civilizations are 
the most famous, but they weren't all sweetness and light. These impressive 
temples were built as public displays of wealth and power, by kings and 
conquerors. They were built almost entirely by slave labor, drawn from the 
conquered.</p>

<p>Modern Pagans have no desire to re-establish slavery - they leave that 
to the Southern Baptists, who still long for it. Further, The wealthy and 
powerful of our day have zero interest in public works at their expense, and 
are very resentful of being taxed by governments to finance works benefiting 
the public.</p>

<p>Here in North America, with no temple tradition, our Temples must be 
private, or like a nomad's yurt, erected as needed, and taken down when 
the need is finished.</p>
<br>

<h2>Altars <small>&amp;</small> Shrines</h2>

<p><img src="img/pg_Sophia08k.jpg" alt="Shrine to Lady Sophia" class=mrg>
The household Altar is the primary sacred space for most Pagans today, 
most of whom belong to no Coven, Circle, Temple or other organization. 
The altar can vary from being so simple others won't even notice what it
is, or elaborate, or even large and elaborate, depending on the space, 
needs, and intent of the person who has dedicated it. It can even be 
portable. The Altar is definitive between Pagan and "Spiritual but not 
Religious".</p>

<p>An Altar is a workspace, whether for meditation, or for magic. It is a 
dynamic space that may change with the season, or the task at hand. If it 
is dedicated to a Deity, it should have an image or statuette of the Deity 
to act as a portal for communication with that Deity. Offerings are are 
often made at the altar, and prayers.</p>

<p>An Altar is appropriate for Deist and non-Deist Pagans alike. Even for 
atheist Pagans (yes, there are those), as a focus for their self development. 
Witches often dedicate their Altars to the goddess Hekate (say "Hekatee"), 
who carries two torches to light the way through the darkness, as well as 
may other attributes.</p>

<p>A Shrine is much like an alter, but more for commemoration and giving 
thanks. It can be dedicated to household spirits, ancestors, a Deity, 
or an honored person. It is likely to be a place for meditation, but is 
less dynamic than an alter. Offerings and prayers may also be submitted 
at a Shrine. Both Altars and Shrines are sacred spaces that have a place 
in the Pagan household.</p>
<br>

<h2>Casting Circles</h2>

<p><img src="img/pg_circle01k.jpg" alt="Casting a Circle" class=mrg>
Casting a Circle is a way to define Sacred Space in a temporary 
manner. It is well known from use by Wiccans and similar practitioners, for 
their periodic group rituals. Similar Castings are used in many forms of 
Paganism, Witchcraft, Ceremonial Magic, and Sorcery.</p>

<p>The "Circle" may be envisioned as a sphere, circular wall, or cone, 
depending on practice. It serves to keep unwanted influences out, or 
to invite desired influences in, or both. It is also done to change the 
emotions, expectations and state of mind of those within it, whether a 
group or a solo practitioner.</p>

<p>Once Cast, the circle is ritually cleansed, often with smoke and 
incense, but also in many other ways. Then the ritual may begin. A room 
permanently dedicated to Sacred work may not need a circle cast every time, 
but the dedication ceremony will probably be in very similar form, and it 
will be similarly cleansed before a ritual. A properly concepted home altar 
is a permanent sacred space, and will usually need only cleansing, without 
any formal casting.</p> 

<p>The Wiccan casting always features calls to the four directions, and is 
closely tied to the Wheel of the Seasons, which is at the very root of 
Wiccan practice. This is, however, not the only way Circles are Cast. Some 
are entirely circular, or spherical, without a call to the directions, or 
the seasons. Some may call the Elemental Spirits rather than the seasonal 
directions.</p>

<p>Casting Circles is a very serious matter to Wiccans, and to those of 
similar practices. These Castings are intended for group rituals, rituals 
that are expected to seriously raise consciousness into higher realms, to 
commune with spirits and deities. Casting of such Sacred Space must be 
taken very seriously, and properly managed, and there may be dangers to 
contend with.</p>

<p>The success of a serious casting depends on the skills and state of 
mind of the person charged with the Casting. This person must work intensely 
to improve his or her self, by meditation, exercises, study, and rehearsal. 
If you desire to become a really serious caster of Sacred Space, you might 
study Ivo Dominguez Jr's book, <b><i>Casting Sacred Space</i></b>. It is 
thorough, taking these things very seriously, and is designed in a way 
that it can serve many different forms of practice, group or solo.</p>

<p>In many cases, a Casting need not be so intense, but it still should 
be taken seriously, studied, and well formed. The intensity needs to be 
scaled to the intent of the casting. Again, it isn't a mechanical operation 
and depends very much on the state of mind of the caster.</p>

<h2 class=lrg>Disclaimer</h2>

<p><img src="img/Freya02e.jpg" alt="Freya" class=mrg>
I am a largely Non-Theist Pagan, but have recently been doing some work 
with Freya, who seems to be branching out from her Germanic roots - 
note her very India style pose and Japanese companion (Shinto I presume). 
It's all OK, since Vedic Hinduism originated from the same Proto 
Indo-European root as Germanic Paganism.</p>
