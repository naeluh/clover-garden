<h1>A Pagan Reality<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  - In Our Time</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>As our ancestors developed into the humans of today, they created 
various constructs for spiritual support, community continuity, and 
understanding of a strange and dangerous world - what are known today 
as "mythology, or "religion" (depending on if it's yours or not).</p>

<p> It is important to understand that the humans of our historical 
past were just as smart as people are today, possibly smarter than 
many people today, because they had to be smart to survive. They were, 
however, working with a lot less accumulated knowledge and in a 
largely illiterate community. They had to find ways to work around 
those limitations, and did.</p>

<p>While each region has its own format, there is considerable 
consistency in structure. They included many gods, goddesses and 
spirits representing natural forces and the structures of human 
society, and how they interact. Personalizing natural and social 
forces was a powerful tool, and still is.</p>

<p>In some regions this structure eventually became subverted by 
reduction of the broad pantheon to a single authoritarian and rather 
violent and intolerant father figure, patterned after the kings of 
the regions. This expressed the absolute "God given" authority of the 
king, demanded absolute obedience, and supported war against and 
slaughter of all others, for appropriation of their lands and wealth. 
This authority extends to destruction of nature, and balance in the 
world.</p>

<p>The monotheistic format has progressed into absurdity. Further travel 
along this path threatens destruction of humanity itself. This has 
influenced many people to reject this "divine authority" and search for 
some more gentle, egalitarian and more ecologically realistic structure.

<h2 class=lrg>Overview</h2>

<p>Here you will find a quick look at basic concepts of modern Pagan 
philosophies and their current expression. We take a fairly Eurocentric 
view, which includes the non-native Paganism of North America, Australia 
and New Zealand. While there are significant parallels with native 
religions worldwide, it is best to consider them  separately, as their 
environments and history are so dissimilar.</p>

<h2>Paganism is Not "A Religion"</h2>

<p><img src="img/circles01c.jpg" alt="Orientations of Paganism" class=mrg>
Paganism today is a movement encompassing a dizzying array of philosophies, 
associations, attitudes, and yes, religions. There are many happy to call 
themselves Pagans, but some prefer Heathen (German for Pagan) or 
Witch, and some prefer no classification.</p>

<p>Current thinking presents Paganism as consisting of four Orientations. 
Most Pagans, groups or individuals, focus on one of these Orientations, 
but all overlap with the other three, in varying degrees.</p>

<h3>Nature:</h3> &nbsp; This Orientation is so prevalent Paganism has 
been called "a group of Nature religions". Pagans see themselves as 
embedded in Nature, participating in the world, not as masters and 
exploiters, but as protectors of the Earth and all life. Some are 
vegetarians, or even vegans, in support of this involvement. Many are 
Animists, considering <u>all</u> things endowed with consciousness 
appropriate to their place. Larger entities are seen as summations of 
the smaller consciousnesses within them.<p></p>

<h3>Deity:</h3> &nbsp; Gods and Goddesses are recognized and respected 
by almost all Pagans, even most atheist Pagans, but there are many 
concepts of exactly what Deities <u>are</u>. To atheists, they are 
aspects of the human psyche, to others, they are living beings quite 
separate from humans, to all they are symbols representing complex 
relationships. Many Pagans have a big dose of Deity in their Orientation, 
and many have a special relationship with one or more of them. The 
concept of the one, and only one, great all powerful, jealous, and 
vengeful Creator God of the Abrahamic religions is roundly rejected by 
Pagans.<p></p>

<h3>Self:</h3> &nbsp; This Orientation recognizes the Divine within the 
Self. Emphasis is on self development, becoming wiser, stronger, more 
compassionate, and more magical, to be of greater service to the world.
Magical practices are included here, including, but not exclusive to, 
Witches and Sorcerers. Many Witches are also strongly Deity oriented, 
especially to the Goddess Hekate (say "Hekatee"), and there is usually 
a strong Nature Orientation included.<p></p>

<h3>Community:</h3> &nbsp; Here emphasis is not on the individual, but 
on harmony and continuity of the Family and Community. Immortality is to 
the Family, not the Individual. Veneration of Ancestors, household 
spirits, and hospitality to strangers are major aspects of this 
Orientation. In many cases a strong Deity Orientation is also present.
<p></p>

<h2>What Does Paganism Offer?</h2>

<p><img src="img/pg_sun02s.jpg" alt="Sun Candle" class=mrg>
Paganism offers a spiritual path that is softer, gentler and more 
satisfying than any offered by the Abrahamic religions, or Secular 
Materialism. It is not a path you must blaze alone, because it is 
the path of your ancestors, and it is a path being turned to by a 
growing number of people around the world.</p>

<p>Paganism offers freedom from belief - in exchange for understanding. 
Belief is the very center of Christianity, but has a rather minor 
place in Paganism. Belief cripples the mind, as psychologists and 
philosophers well understand. People choose belief so they can be 
absolutely certain they are right, without bothering with any thinking, 
and no matter how wrong they may be.</p>

<p>Believers shut their minds and are blind to facts counter to their 
Belief. Believers are easily manipulated by demagogues and rabble 
rousers, as we have recently seen so well in our politics. Many 
demagogues and rabble rousers make a very good living exploiting 
believers.</p>

<p>Paganism is about connectivity and relationships. You are the center 
of your universe, but that is meaningless without context. Paganism 
promotes communion with the Earth and all it's living beings, large and 
small, with the Elemental Realms, with our ancestors, and with people 
living today. There is also an undercurrent of detachment from authority, 
both political and ecclesiastic.</p> 

<p>Paganism is not at all at odds with Science, but complimentary to it. 
This is especially clear with classical physics having reached its 
limits - yet there is still obviously much beyond those limits.</p>

<p>Just beyond those limits is Quantum Physics, sailing perilously close 
to magic. There's a famous statement, given in many wordings and 
attributed to various physicists (earliest attribution is to Niels Bohr), 
but basically, "If you think you understand quantum physics, you are 
wrong". Nonetheless, quantum physics has much useful to offer, and so 
has Paganism, though it is easier to understand.</p>

<p>The Abrahamic religions disparage the world in which we live, and 
our lives in this world. They ask for mindless belief in exchange for 
promise of a far better afterlife, an afterlife they actually know 
nothing about and can offer no evidence for. Pagans consider the world 
we live in to be sacred, and all lives within it to be sacred. This 
is reality, not empty promises in turn for obedience.</p>

<p>One thing that Paganism does not offer is a promise of forgiveness 
in the afterlife. As a Pagan you are totally responsible for your 
actions, and, as they say, Karma can be a bitch. Of course, the 
monotheists are just as bound to responsibility. They just imagine 
they have a way to escape it - through mindless belief.</p>
 
<h3 id="scept">But, OK, You're a Hardened Sceptic</h3>

<p>A sceptic may think this is all just self manipulation and delusion, 
a sort of mental placebo. Well, the things being manipulated are all 
real elements of a person's real and perceived world. Besides, recent 
research has shown that placebos work <i>even if the person taking 
them knows they are placebos</i>.</p>

<p>Do keep in mind that Scientific Objectivism is a closed box with 
impenetrable walls. It has very strict rules and possibilities. Sorry, 
no Warp Drive. If you wish perpetual survival for yourself, or for 
humanity itself, you'd better be looking outside the box. If you wish 
to engage with <a href="../memorium/ajg/etintel.html">
<b>Other Intelligences</b></a>, you need to look outside the box for 
that too.</p>

<p>Besides, a Pagan lifestyle is a lot more fun than scepticism, 
and the parties are better. Give it a try, you may like it. Just start 
introducing a few little elements, a few gentle rituals, and let it 
grow. I knew a couple of hard core atheist-realists who played 
around with mock rituals for fun - and ended up as Pagan priests.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h2>Foundation</h2>

<p><img src="img/pg_sky01c.jpg" alt="Stary Space" class=mrg>
In the beginning, there was Nothing - but Nothing is simultaneous 
with Everything. Nothing is the mutual negation of Positive and 
Negative. Nothing has the potential to express itself as Everything, 
by bursting into an infinitely fine haze of Positive and Negative. 
Aspects of this haze are then capable of recombining in an infinite 
number of ways, to form stars, planets, all we can see and feel, 
and much more besides.</p>

<p>You must be clear that of Positive and Negative, neither is "good" 
nor the other "evil". Good and Evil are purely constructs of human 
understanding, and have no place outside of human protocols. Within 
the realm of human protocols, however, concepts of Good and Evil are 
<u>extremely important</u> for progress along the infinite path 
of becoming.</p>

<p>The basic error of the Abrahamic Religions is found in the story of 
the Garden of Eden. Humans have eaten of the fruit of <i>The Tree of 
Knowledge of Good and Evil</i>. "Behold, he has become as we, knowing 
the difference between Good and Evil".</p>

<p>This is a triumphant step for humanity on the path of becoming.  
It is a huge step beyond the animal state. Problem: it brings with 
it responsibility. Each man and each woman, knowing the difference 
between Good and Evil, is responsible for his or her actions. 
Accepting this, and acting in accordance, is essential to personal 
progress, and the progress of humanity as a whole.</p>

<p>Yet, these "revealed religions" blame this advancement on "sin", 
and seek a return to the "state of grace", to the animal state, where 
God is responsible for everything. They hold that all sins are forgiven 
by simply believing in God (or his incarnation as Jesus), or by 
submission as obedient property of Allah. This forgiveness is promised 
by the priesthoods, without fear of ever having to deliver.</p>

<p>This isn't going to happen - there is no going back. Pandora's Jar 
has been opened. You <u>must</u> accept responsibility for your own 
actions, or you fall into the realm of the subhuman. That is a basic 
tenant of Paganism.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="who">Who are Pagans?</h2>

<p><img src="img/pg_LadyC01k.jpg" alt="Lady of Cornwal Group" class=mrg>
First lets clear up a misconception promoted by churches and the 
popular media. Pagans are not at all related to Satanists. Satanism 
is a "reversal" child of Christianity and Hebraic tradition, and has 
nothing to do with our pre-Christian religions or with modern Paganism. 
Some into esoteric forms of Satanism may object to this definition, and 
some of these groups are sufficiently well behaved to be accepted by 
Pagan communities, but certainly don't define Paganism.</p>

<p>Let's also clear up another misconception, that Paganism is a 
religion of country folks. This was promulgated by early Christians 
and amplified by Baroque and Victorian romantic notions. Paganism has 
always been at its height in the urban centers where the arts and 
commerce flourished. This remains true today. While a number 
of prominent Pagan writers revel in their country homes and connection 
with nature, the Pagan Revival is centered firmly in the costal cities 
that are the centers of the arts, science and commerce. The country 
bumpkins pretty much all claim to be Christians, but most pretty much 
ignore the teachings of Jesus.</p>

<p>On the whole, the question of who Pagans are isn't an easy one to 
answer. Significant research has been done on this subject in English 
speaking countries. The prominent social polling organization, Pew 
Research, calculates there are over 1 million Pagans in the United 
States alone.</p>

<p>In some European countries, including in the Baltic and Caucasus, 
Pagan movements are officially recognized by governments. Now (2020), 
Italy has certified a Pagan organization as official. In Armenia, the 
first country to be converted to Christianity, the Church has accepted 
the Pagan movement as an ally in preserving Armenian traditions and 
identity. </p>

<p>It must be firmly noted that the majority of Pagans, especially here 
in North America, are solo practitioners, belonging to no circle, 
coven or other organized or disorganized group. They keep contact as 
a community mainly through magazines and the Internet.</p>

<p>Back in the "Teen Witch" era of the 1970s, the average age of folks 
declaring themselves Pagan was about 16. A study that closed in 2014 
found it was now older than 26. That study group is currently working 
on a re-run which will probably push the average age higher. Of course 
there are many Pagans today who are well over 26 - those in the 70+ 
bracket who paved the way for the younger set.</p>

<p>A study conducted in the West Coast States of the United States 
found Pagans were generally very well educated, including many 
professionals, and tended to be avid readers, much more so than the 
general population. In North America, Pagan communities are most dense 
on the East and West coasts of the United States, the commercial and 
cultural centers.</p>

<p>Pagans are found in many walks of life, but some are rather 
secretive about it. This is particularly true of teachers, as some 
have been fired, in both the UK and the US, when school administrators 
found they were Pagans. In some regions, like the US "Bible Belt", 
other careers are also at risk, and in Islamic regions, lives are at 
serious risk.</p>


<p><br></p>

<h2 id="diety">Gods <small>&amp;</small> Goddesses</h2>

<p><img src="img/thoth01s.jpg" alt="Thoth" class=mrg>
Pagans respect the Gods and Goddesses. They are real, but concepts of 
just <u>what</u> they are vary widely. Some consider them to be entities 
unto themselves, completely independent of humans. At the other end are 
those who consider them elements of the human psyche.</p>

<p>Most Pagan orientations are polytheistic, pantheistic or animistic, 
or some combination of these, but there are a few that consider 
themselves monotheists, and quite a few that consider themselves 
atheist. There is a thick book, <i>Godless Paganism</i>, in which many 
non-theistic Pagans express how and why they are Pagans. What unites 
all these diverse people as Pagans is the use of ritual, simple or 
complex, deep respect for all life, the natural world and universe, 
and a disregard for ecclesiastic authority.</p>

<p>Some Pagans insist that you must believe in multiple Gods and 
Goddesses that have an independent existence from you, or you can't be 
Pagan. These are our "fundamentalists", and they say this must be so 
because it was the way of our ancestors. Many Pagans do not agree, 
and, in fact, our ancestors had rather diverse attitudes towards the 
nature of Deities, of humanity, and of the universe itself.</p>

<p>Pagan Gods and Goddesses have been described as humanly understandable 
personifications of the forces of nature, and aspects of human personality 
and culture. This imagery was particularly helpful for explaining complex 
interactions in a pre-literate society, but is still powerful for cultural 
and personal purposes today.</p>

<p>Observe how great temples are no longer built to the Greek and Roman 
Gods and Goddesses. The early Christian emperors decreed, and enforced, 
a death penalty for Pagan worship. Yet observe how important they remain 
in literature and art. Could there have been a Renaissance without them? 
These are powerful images that are still relevant today.</p>

<p>Named Gods and Goddesses gain power and relevance with acceptance by a 
community. It matters not whether they are named and defined by that 
community. They personify real powers that affect our lives, and are part 
of the coherence and understanding of human community. They are to be 
respected.</p>

<p>One theory holds that the Gods were designed and named by communities, 
but over time, the energy sent to them by their followers enabled them to 
consolidate into actual independent beings, beings of a very different 
sort from what we are. These beings may have an interest in human affairs, 
and may sometimes agree to aid humans, but they have their own priorities, 
and sometimes ask humans to assist.</p>

<p>People say they communicate with Deities. Can these Deities actually 
<u>be</u> independent beings, however they originated? That seemed 
scientifically absurd, but no longer seems so absurd to science. If we, in 
our consciousness, operate in the physical world, but are not <u>of</u> 
the physical world, could not other beings also reside in that realm? For 
more on this new science see our <a href="Subtle01.html#21st"><b>Subtle 
Body - 21st Century</b></a> page.</p>

<p>Many Theist Pagans concentrate entirely on a single God or Goddess, while 
accepting there being many others. This is called "Henotheism". Some people 
have said they have been "serially monotheistic", changing focus to a 
different single Deity as their lives changed. This is called Kathenotheism, 
worshiping one Deity at a time, each in turn as the Supreme Deity.</p>

<p>Gods and Goddesses can be thought entirely personal, or they can be 
considered archetypes (Jungian Paganism). Even those who do not accept 
Gods and Goddesses as such often use their names freely in conversation, 
because they are a convenient shorthand for discussion of complex matters.
</p>

<p>The most important thing is <u>Understanding</u>. You must understand 
the powers and influences that compose a Deity that interests you, and 
for what purpose those powers and influences are relevant to your life. 
This takes serious study, not just making stuff up. You must understand 
how you desire to interact with that Deity and act consistently with that 
understanding. It matters not whether you think of that Deity as part of 
yourself or as an external being, the Deities are real.</p>

<p>The monotheistic God was patterned after human kings, to justify the 
actions of human kings. All other aspects of nature and human society were 
subservient to the king. Since that God is designed by His worshipful 
community, the design needs to change with changes in the community. Some 
now claim a "patient, loving God", quite at odds with the jealous and 
vengeful God of their scriptures. This causes tremendous inconsistency 
in the Christian religion.</p>

<p>Yes, the concept of a single all encompassing God is a powerful tool for 
promoting tyranny, wars of aggression, and suppression of "infidels", but, 
by its nature, contains many inescapable conflicts and inconsistencies of 
both logic and theology.</p>

<p>"Mommy, if God is so good, sees everything and is all powerful, why do 
such bad things happen to so many good people?" Because of such conflicts 
and inconsistencies monotheistic religions have had to appoint at least one 
other being with God-like powers, such as Satan, but just not call him a 
God, because there can be only one, they say. This leads to further 
inconsistencies. "It's hard to believe in God when certain people are 
never smitten with lightning bolts." 
<br class=cll></p>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="wight">Household Spirits</h2>

<p><img src="img/pg_hhspirits03c.jpg" alt="Home for Household Spirits" class=mrg>
[Housewight (English, current); H&uacute;sv&aelig;ttir (Norse); 
Lares (Roman); Domovoy (Russian); Domowik (Polish); Gasin (Korean); Cofgodas 
(Anglo-Saxon)]</p>

<p>Household Spirits and/or Deities are a feature of pretty much every ancient 
Pagan religion, and may include ancestral spirits. They are taken seriously by 
a number of current Pagan forms, especially by Witches. Their powers are much 
less than those of the major Deities, but are strong locally. Their place is 
most often in the kitchen, previously the hearth.</p>
<p>The most well known and studied are the 
Lares of Roman Paganism, which were important in every household, with special 
places, and to whom offerings were periodically provided. Household spirits 
are generally helpful, especially if one becomes sensitive to their 
communication, but they like things clean and definitely dislike conflict in 
the household.</p>
<p>The photo shows an installation placed for Housewights, offering a nice 
jar to live in, and guardian shells. They are disembodied spirits so can go 
in and out of the jar without it being open, and, like a TARDIS it is much 
larger on the inside than on the outside. The house itself, built of natural 
materials from the Earth, is considered also to have a Spirit of its own.
<br class=cll></p>

<p><br></p>


<h2 id="myths">Myths <small>and</small> Archetypes</h2>

<p><img src="img/Michael01c.jpg" alt="Archangel Michael" class=mrg>
Myth is very important to every religion of this world, including 
yours (whatever it may be). Myths are not things that have happened 
in our world - but metaphors - they are not be taken literally, but 
as guides and patterns. They define the nature of humans and their 
societies in an understandable way.</p>

<p>Archetypes are very much part of the mythic realm. They are 
master patterns for behavior and the structure of society, for both 
the individual and the community. They influence all members of the 
community through the unconscious mind. Persons who become very 
prominent within a community tend to be aligned with one of its 
archetypes, warrior, magician, healer, etc.</p>

<p>Christianity has tried to suppress archetypes, feeling they lead 
far too easily to polytheistic Paganism. Perhaps the strongest  
Christian archetype is Mary, who, in some forms of Christianity, became 
a major object of worship, especially as a replacement for Vesta, the 
Roman goddess of the household. In reaction, other forms, particularly 
Protestantism, have relegated her almost to insignificance. The warrior 
archangel Michael has also filled an archetype roll. Jungian psychology 
has placed Jesus as the archetype of the self.</p>

<p>Was Jesus a living person or a myth? There is very scant 
non-Christian evidence that he was a living person, and what little 
there is remains highly suspect, some of it clearly forgery. Some 
scholars consider him entirely mythical, but most are satisfied with 
"everyone knows he was a real person" as evidence of his existence. 
Many scholars who are certain he was a physical person still freely 
admit that much written in the Gospels is mythical. Those who believe 
the Bible is the unerring Word of God must first choose which of the 
many versions, all revised and edited by men, is the unerring one.</p>

<p>Whether or not Jesus was a real person is a relatively modern concern. 
In the days of early Christianity, people were quite accustomed to 
myth and understood its purpose in defining their culture. In the end, 
it doesn't matter - the story of Jesus fills a mythic role.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="belief">Belief</h2>

<p><img src="img/pg_bible01c.jpg" alt="A Holy Book" class=mrg>
<span class=tf>There are two forms of Belief. One is totally necessary - the 
other cripples the mind.</span></p>
<h3>Hard Belief:</h3> &nbsp; This is faith based belief, without 
examination, and without evidence. It is belief based on "authority", whether 
from written sources (ancient or recent), persons (living or dead), or the 
birth community. This form of Belief is extremely popular, because it relieves 
the believer from having to think. It allows them total certainty they are 
absolutely right, no matter how wrong they are. Believers are very easy to 
manipulate.

<p>Prominent promoters are the Christian Churches, and especially Islam, but 
it isn't restricted to religion - let me present QAnon. Hard Belief cannot 
be changed from without, don't bother trying. Psychologists find that a 
believer (in whatever), presented with incontrovertible evidence their belief 
is error, goes away from the encounter believing even more strongly. They are 
unable to use logic with anything that touches their belief. This sort of 
Belief can be broken only from within, and that can be very traumatic to the 
believer.</p>

<h3>Soft Belief:</h3> &nbsp; This is Belief we can, and must, live by. 
This form is appropriate for Pagans, in spirituality as well as general 
living. It is a working Belief supported by evidence, and particularly by 
personal experience. This sort of belief enhances the mind, rather than 
crippling it. Science is the poster child for Soft Belief. Hard laws of 
Science have been changed time and again when new evidence became known. 
Science has been valid for physical reality only, but today, scientists are 
increasingly accepting that physical reality is not "all there is" - based 
on evidence. What exactly non-physical reality is, is still undefined.
<p></p>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="worship">Worship</h2>

<p><img src="img/pg_worship01c.jpg" alt="Slavic Pagan Worship" class=mrg>
Are Gods and Goddesses to be worshiped?  They are very much to be respected 
for what they personify - no matter what your concept of the Deities might 
be. We do not, and cannot really know what they are. They may be consulted, 
they may be asked for help or favors. Some may try to propitiate them, some 
even threaten them (dangerous). Community defined deities may have priests 
to explain them and interface with them, but do the Deities actually have 
need for worship?</p>

<p>Persons who work with Deities on a regular basis assure us they appreciate 
being recognized and respected. Regular offerings and respectful greetings 
are evidence of that respect. You may consider this respect as worship. One 
hint: If you have not established a regular and respectful relationship with 
a Deity, don't bother asking for favors, they will be ignored, if you are 
lucky. Deities are busy about Deity things, with Deity objectives, and 
only a fool would claim to know what those are. Deities may also ask you 
to do things for them. You can decline, but if you make promises, you'd 
better deliver.</p> 

<p>As with other forms of magic, worship works most effectively on the self. 
Formal worship serves, often quite powerfully, to reinforce the connection 
between the person or community and the Deity subject to the worship, and to 
reinforce the definition of that Deity in the minds and lives of the 
worshipers. Worship should not be disparaged, it can be very important to a 
person's Pagan practice, or to the cohesion of a community - no matter what 
you concept of Deities is.</p>
 
<p><br></p>

<h2 id="ritual">Ritual <small>&amp;</small> Liturgy</h2>

<p><img src="img/pg_altar01c.jpg" alt="Wiccan Altar" class=mrg>
Ritual is a defining aspect of Paganism. Even atheist Pagans engage in 
ritual, simple or complex, personal or communal. It is a practice that 
works to focus, stabilize and give meaning to our lives. Most Pagans 
maintain an altar in their home. It can be tiny and very simple, or 
quite complex. What matters is that it provides a meaningful focus in 
life. A daily ritual of addressing the subject of the altar is very 
common and serves to initiate the day in a familiar way.</p>

<p>The importance of ritual is very much appreciated by mainstream  
religions, but their clergies maintain control of those rituals and their 
performance. Such public offerings are called "Liturgy". Standard 
liturgy for particular stages of life, such as birth, marriage, coming 
of age, death, etc. is a way the priesthoods maintain continuous control 
over the lives of their congregations.</p>

<p>Some Pagan organizations may also have standard liturgy, but if it 
has become control oriented, patterned after the mainstream religions, 
then it is an organization to avoid, probably one promoting a cult of 
personality around its leader. Leaders intent on building a personality 
cult prefer weak followers - be strong and avoid them.</p>

<h2 id="circle">Sacred Space</h2>

<p><a href="Circle01.html">
<img src="img/pa_circ01k.jpg" alt="Stone Circle, England" class=mrg></a>
Among Pagans, you will very often hear of "Casting a Circle". What is 
this and why? Concerning Sacred Space, Pagans are in a nomadic mode. 
Christianity was spread by blood and fire, all the sacred Pagan temples 
of Europe were destroyed. Of course, in the New World, and "Down Under" 
there never were any. Lacking permanent sacred sites, Pagans must create 
them on the fly. There are various paths to Sacred Space, and some are 
described in our page <a href="Circle01.html"><b>Defining Sacred 
Space</b></a>.</p>

<p>"Casting a Circle". is an opening step for many rituals, both private 
and group. It demarks a space that can be cleansed and made sacred, and 
dedicated to the ritual. It creates a border clearly marked out to 
forbid entry of disruptive influences. This is the temple, and when 
the ritual is finished, it is thanked and dismissed.</p>

<p>A dedicated altar in a private home does not need a circle cast 
before use. It is a permanent sacred space. Group rituals and certain 
other operations within that home will need a Circle cast. There are 
some sacred places in Nature that do not need a Circle cast.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="divin">Divination</h2>

<p><img src="img/pg_tarot01c.jpg" alt="Tarot Cards" class=mrg>
Many Pagans at least dabble in Divination, and some are very serious 
about it, while rationalists may scoff. Those who have worked with 
divination know it can't predict the future, it is a tool for the here 
and now. In the hands of a skilled practitioner, it can be especially 
valuable as a counseling tool.</p>

<p>Any Pagan who is interested in divination does hundreds of 
divinations on themselves, but that doesn't usually work well - the 
desires and expectations of the reader are too close and interfere with 
the reading. This is, however, necessary to learn the chosen method, 
to become comfortable with it and develop a personal style. Then the 
reader can become helpful to others.</p>

<p>As with Psychologists, there are very good readers, and not so 
good readers. Essentials of the good reader are detachment from 
the reading, and empathy for the client - and a method appropriate 
to the reader. The magic is in the reader, not the method.</p>
 
<p>I prefer tarot, because each card has deep, complex meanings, but the 
whole deck cannot quite be completely reconciled. Formulating a fully 
coherent system has always squirmed away from even the most astute 
practitioners who have tried. This forces the reader to think along 
unaccustomed paths during a reading, and the results can be surprising.
</p>

<p>Astrology was similarly effective, until it got computerized. Again, 
the magic is in the reader, and computers aren't magical. Astrology 
today is still very useful to Pagans as a system of symbology, and as 
associated with the cycle of the seasons - see <a href="Pagan01.html#astrol">
<b>Astrology</b></a>.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="magic">Magic <small>&amp;</small> Prayer</h2>

<p><img src="img/pg_magic01c.jpg" alt="GrisGris" class=mrg>
Today, we are living in a time of resurgence of Magic, by Pagans and Witches 
(who may or may not consider themselves Pagans). Some Pagans enthusiastically 
engage in formal Magic, some to a lesser extent or not at all, and some resist 
its use, holding it to be an attempt to usurp the powers of the Gods.</p>

<p> Some leading practitioners report good success rates, but say Magic 
improves the odds that something will happen, and cannot force it to happen. 
They also warn that the physical world is most successfully influenced by 
physical means. When such means are available, use them, but when they 
aren't, there's Magic.</p>

<p>Magic is often describe by practitioners as taking three basic forms, 
which may be used alone, or in combination, depending on circumstances 
and the objective of the working.</p>

<p><b>Theurgy</b> works to acquire or channel power and/or assistance from 
a God or Goddess. Prayer is a light form of Theurgy, but to use Theurgy 
effectively, one must have already formed a relationship with the God or 
Goddess. They are under no obligation, so a working relationship is needed. 
This is a point Christians might also take note of.</p>

<p><b>Energy Magic</b> uses techniques to raise energy that can be applied to 
a particular goal. It can be by an individual or by a group, often using 
rituals or meditation. The energy may come from the earth, the sky, the self, 
or other sources, and is not related to the electromagnetic energy of physical 
science. This practice requires understanding of, and particularly practice 
with, the chosen methods.</p>

<p><b>Psychological Magic</b> is used to influence the internal state of the 
person, or of the community if performed together. So used, such operations 
can be quite effective. A skilled practitioner can definitely influence and 
encourage changes in themselves or another person present, but affecting 
people remotely is a more questionable matter.<p> 

<p>For most folks, that Magic influences worldly things, events, or people 
remains controversial. Does Magic have an influence in planes other than the 
physical? Are there such planes? It seems pretty certain there are realms 
unknown to physics, and I say that from personal experience, as well the 
experience of others.</p>

<p>Be mindful that Magic can be dangerous. We know little about the 
planes on which it works, or just how they may affect the physical world. 
Exploration of realms beyond the physical is not invalid or futile, but 
it must be cautiously based on careful consideration, experience, and 
reference to the work of other serious practitioners. Attempts to force 
evidence to support pre-conceived structures or produce "scientific proof" 
will fail.

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="after">Afterlife</h2>

<p><img src="img/pg_egypt001c.jpg" alt="Egyptian Funerary Gods" class=mrg>
Most Pagan belief systems include concepts of an afterlife, however, 
details are unclear. An afterlife can not at all resemble the 
kindergarten version promoted by the Christians, or the "gentlemen's 
club" pattern of Islam. It cannot be anything like life in this world, 
as all the physical infrastructure that supports our form of existence 
will have been returned to the Earth from which it came. The Tibetan 
Buddhists are the ones that have intensively studied the after death 
experience, so should be the ones consulted on these matters.</p>

<p>Reincarnation is included in many Pagan world views, and should 
be mandatory for any that claim heritage from the Druids. That they 
believed in indestructibility of the human soul and reincarnation is 
among the very few things we actually know about the ancient Druids.
<br class=cll></p>


<p><br></p>

<h2 id="subtle">Subtle Bodies</h2>
<p><a href="Subtle01.html">
<img src="img/pg_aura01s.jpg" alt="Human Aura" class=mrg></a>
That we have a presence in realms outside the physical is a very important 
concept in just about every non-Christian religion in the world, and in 
some non-religious philosophies as well. This concept has been very harshly, 
sometimes violently, suppressed by the Christian churches, but was accepted 
by early forms of Christianity. It survives to this day in various Gnostic 
Christian denominations, and to some extent in the Eastern Church.</p>

<p>Many, but not all Pagans accept this concept, adapting views from the 
Hindus, Sufis, Buddhists, Taoists, and from Western Hermeticism. All these 
sources testify to the reality of these "Subtle Bodies" and to experience 
working with them, though differing in details, such as the number of layers.
</p> 
<p>The Physical Sciences, by definition, are restricted to the physical 
realm. They can neither prove nor disprove these concepts, as they are not 
of the physical realm. Quantum physics, however, having satisfactorily 
demonstrated existence of an "outside", mathematicians and physicists have 
become increasingly accepting that consciousness and mind may act from 
outside the physical realm. We now have a detail page for 
<a href="Subtle01.html"><b>Subtle Bodies</b></a> and wish to point out the 
<i>21st Century</i> section in particular (near the bottom).

<h2 id="recon" class=lrg>Pagan Reconstructionism  <small>&amp;</small> Eclecticism</h2>

<p><img src="img/pg_Hellen02c.jpg" alt="Helenic Ceremony" class=mrg>
Early in the development of modern Paganism, in the 60s and 70s, it 
was felt extremely important that Paganism derive its legitimacy from 
deep in the roots of ancient times. Unfortunately, almost nothing was 
known of these roots, so it was mostly made up from very sketchy 
sources. Today, we deeply respect our ancient roots, but we can stand 
on our own. We need not make unsupported claims which are now so easily 
debunked by skeptics, archaeologists and historians.</p> 

<p>There are two basic approaches to these ancient roots, 
Reconstructionism and Eclecticism. "We might say that Reconstructionist 
Pagans romanticize the past, while Eclectic Pagans idealize the future. 
In the first case, there is a deeply felt need to connect with the past 
as a source of spiritual strength and wisdom; in the second case, there 
is the idealistic hope that a spirituality of nature can be gleaned from 
ancient sources and shared with all humanity." - Religious studies 
scholar Michael Strmiska.</p>

<p>These two approaches are complimentary and I expect they will 
gradually move closer to each other. The Reconstructionists work 
hard to analyze and recreate their past religion accurately, though 
they may have precious little to work from. Some of what they find 
is not suited to the modern world. The Eclectics should incorporate 
more actual historical Paganism, which they can get from the 
Reconstructionists, and can in turn help the Reconstructionists 
adjust to the modern world.</p>

<h2 class=lrg>Reconstructionism</h2>

<p><img src="img/pg_romuva01c.jpg" alt="Romuvan World Tree Symbol" class=mrg>
The most successful reconstructionist groups are from regions that 
have very strong folk traditions. These include the Baltic countries 
and Russia. In Abkhazia, which has broken away from Georgia, the Pagan 
traditions did not completely die out. Sacred sites were preserved, 
and the priesthood persisted to a degree. The Christian churches are 
increasingly seen there as tools of the oppressor, with a growing 
portion of the population adopting the old religion.</p>

<p>Some reconstructionist groups try to limit their membership to 
people of a particular ethnicity, at the risk of being called 
racist. Due to rapid transportation and migration in the modern 
world, this is becoming increasingly less viable. What if your 
father was Lithuanian and you mother was Greek? Clearly, these 
groups will have to institute flexibility, or they're going to go 
extinct again.</p>

<p>Some established reconstructionist groups are resentful of ongoing 
religious studies and archaeology, which have provided new understandings 
that conflict with their established reconstruction. This has caused 
some angry exchanges on the Internet. Reconstructionists should be 
fully prepared to adapt to new knowledge, even if it's not pretty.</p>

<p>Ossetia, in southern Russia and north central Georgia, is a good 
source for European Pagan material, as it was never successfully 
converted to either Christianity or Islam, and about a third of the 
people still adhere to an unbroken native tradition.</p>

<p>Some Pagan groups maintain close relations with Hindu groups. The 
unbroken Hindu tradition is particularly relative to Pagan revivals in 
Europe, because it is an Indo-European religion, though one that has 
a very different history and been very much elaborated.</p>

<p>There are reconstructionist groups working to reconstruct the 
native religions of the Near and Middle East, but these groups exist 
almost entirely in North America. Neither Israel nor the Arab 
regions are hotbeds of religious tolerance.</p>

<p>There is even a reconstructionist group in Mexico, working with the 
Aztec religion and philosophy. I am presuming they will not be trying 
to reinstate the mass human sacrifice the Aztecs thought necessary to 
support the continued existence of the world. That has proven unneeded, 
as the world is still here, more or less.</p>


<h2>Kemetism</h2>

<p><img src="img/Kemet03c.jpg" alt="Eye of Horus" class=mrg>
The religion of Ancient Egypt is a special case. Here we have an 
intensely Pagan religion with over 3000 years of detailed documentation, 
a good amount of which is available in English, German and French. There 
isn't a lot to reconstruct here, the main task is to adapt it to the 
modern world. This religion has shown adequate adaptability over those 
3000 years, so that isn't likely to anger the Gods and Goddesses if 
done with care.</p>
<p>Kemetism is also the form of Paganism easiest to adapt to a modern, 
literate, urban society, because that's the kind of society it lived in 
for most of those 3000 years, a society in many respects much like our 
own. Further, there are Gods and Goddesses to fill almost any need or 
preference, and a tradition of appointing new ones as needed. 
They are also free of attachment - nobody today has a valid claim 
to ancient Egyptian heritage - not even the lady who claims to have 
been crowned 196th Pharaoh (in a "secret" ceremony, of course). This 
is definitely a path a person contemplating Paganism should have a 
look into. There are a number of Kemetic groups in North America, 
any number of solo practitioners, and huge amounts of historical data 
to work with.</p>
<p>The one thing we don't have is descriptions of actual rituals. They 
were performed every day and passed down from parents to children. The 
people knew them, so there was no need to write them down. All we have 
is a few fragmentary descriptions by foreigners, so we are on our own 
here. Rituals must be created with deep understanding of the nature 
of what or who is being celebrated.</p>
<p>There is one major factor that makes strict reconstruction problematic. 
Paganism is intensely seasonal, and it was in Egypt as well. The 
problem is, due to the unique conditions of the Nile Valley, they had 
only three seasons, and they are quite at odds with ours. This matter 
needs serious work, and I hope someone is on this issue.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 class=lrg>Eclecticism</h2>

<p>The most prominent examples of eclectic Paganism are Wicca and 
Druidry, as they are the largest and most long established groups, but 
there are others, such as the Goddess Movement and Thelema. There is 
also the category of New Age / Syncretic groups, which blend features 
of two or more loosely related traditions. Reconstructionists consider 
syncretic groups "impure" and unacceptable, even if the traditions 
are legitimately ancient.</p>

<p>It should not be thought that Eclectic Paganism is somehow less 
legitimate than Reconstructed Paganism. While it is a very different 
viewpoint, it serves the needs of its practitioners by building its 
own mythos, and can have a broader appeal than many specific 
reconstructions. Both have much to offer each other.</p>

<img src="img/pg_druid02c.jpg" alt="Druidry Symbol" class=mrg>
<h2>Modern Druidism</h2> (Druidry) originated in the 18th century in 
England, and is made almost completely from new material. Almost nothing 
was recorded about the ancient Druids, and what little exists is at least 
partially suspect, written by persons not friendly to the Druids. Modern 
Druidry was originally a monotheistic movement based loosely on 
Freemasonry. This changed radically in the 20th century, strongly 
influenced by various Pagan revivals and archaeologic evidence. Efforts 
began to reconcile Druidry with what has been learned about Iron Age 
Celtic culture.<p></p>

<p>While there is no central authority, and various Druidry groups 
follow somewhat different paths, it is now a largely polytheistic 
nature based philosophy / religion with strong ecological tendencies. 
Fortunately, the attested practices of animal and human sacrifice 
have not been incorporated, but a belief in reincarnation has been.
A belief in the indestructibility of the human soul and reincarnation 
is one of the very few things we can be certain of from the ancient 
Druids.</p>

<p>Druid groups like to have ceremonies at Stonehenge in England, but 
Stonehenge was built about 2000 years before the first Druids appeared, 
by a people almost nothing is known about, except they were very good 
at astronomical mathematics, and at moving rocks.</p>

<img src="img/pg_pent06c.jpg" alt="Wiccan Symbol" class=mrg>
<h2>Wicca</h2>, the largest Pagan movement in England and the United States, 
is compiled from various sources, with a considerable element of 
reinterpretation and conjecture. It began development in England in 
the early 20th century as a revival of Celtic Witchcraft, derived from 
various folk traditions, many of them proving to be far more recent 
than presumed at the time.<p></p> 

<p>The core beliefs of Traditional British Wicca were set down by 
Gerald Gardener and Doreen Valiente in the late 1940s and early 1950s. 
Gardener claimed initiation by a secret coven of Celtic witches, but 
that has never been verified and seems extremely unlikely. Wicca has 
a much stronger belief in magic than other Pagan practices, most of 
which do not use the term "witch", except to describe a former 
wife or girlfriend.</p>

<p>Most Wiccan groups are still very feminist, having been established 
as a political counter to patriarchal oppression and suppression from 
the monotheists, in some cases with intense paranoia. At root, the 
Horned God is of far less importance than the Moon Goddess. Some 
men get along with the feminism, others consider it excessive, but 
the majority of Wiccan membership are women, and some circles, like 
in Dianic Wicca, are exclusive to women and may be predominantly 
Lesbian.</p>

<p>Wicca has no central authority, and different branches now vary 
considerably, though most recognize and participate in the seasonal 
celebrations. Most also adhere to the Moon Goddess and the Horned God, 
but in some branches they are called the Great Goddess and the Great 
Horned God, because they are held to have many aspects that can appear 
as separate gods and goddesses. This is similar to concepts in Hinduism.
</p>

<p>Wicca is divided into two general categories. British Traditional 
Wicca consists of Gardenarian (founded by Gerald Gardener and Doreen 
Valiente) and Alexandrian (founded by Alex and Maxine Sanders). Other 
circles have been founded by people not initiated into British 
Traditional Wicca.</p>

<p>By 2010 there was some backlash against Wicca from other Pagan 
communities, because in Gardenarian and Alexandrian Wicca the thoughts 
of the founders had become calcified doctrine. By then, however, 
a good number of circles had been established far removed from British 
Traditional, with more flexible and diverse attitudes.</p>
<p><br></p>

<img src="img/wand001c.jpg" alt="Wand" class=mrg>
<h2>Witches</h2> &nbsp; Today we must make a clear distinction: "Wiccan" 
is a religion, "Witch" is a calling, and a craft.

<p>While Wicca is (extremely loosely) based on ancient Celtic witchcraft, 
Wiccans generally do not want to be called "Witches", due to the very 
negative historical connotation. Wiccans generally belong to a Coven 
or Circle and participate in organized group rituals with others of 
their Circle. </p>

<p>Most workers in "The Craft", have enthusiastically accepted the term 
"Witch" and are turning it into a symbol of pride, as other formerly 
suppressed groups have done with what they were called.</p>

<p>Many serious Witches are refugees from the Evangelical Churches and 
other repressive forms of Christianity. Most Witches are solo practitioners 
and do not belong to a coven or other organization. They practice herbalism, 
healing magic, divination, and other crafts, generally for the public good. 
Some teach Witchcraft. Not all Witches think of themselves as Pagans, and 
some think of themselves as Christians.</p>

<p>Many of the most serious Witches are devotees of the Goddess Hekate 
(say Hekatee, not Hek-kate as Shakespeare did). Hekate is still one of the 
most misunderstood Goddesses, no thanks at all to Shakespeare, and often 
pictured as an old, ugly, and wicked queen of darkness. In Classical times, 
she was always pictured as young, and carrying two torches to help light 
your way through the darkness. It is she who guided Persephone back from 
Hades to her mother Demeter. In later antiquity, she was pictured as a 
Triple Goddess, but all three aspects were young.</p>

<p>Despite all this, by far the largest contingent of "Witches" is 
"Aesthetic Witches" (there are less polite terms). They love the look, the 
bling, the rep, and casting spells, but reject the learning, attitude of 
service, respect for spirits, and deep devotion to The Craft typical of real 
Witches. Many real Witches do not adopt the look or the bling at all.</p>

<p>Despite all this New Witch attitude and reconceptualizing of witchcraft, 
I still love Ambrose Bierce's definition:
<br>"Witch n (1) An ugly and repulsive old woman in a wicked league with the 
Devil. &nbsp; (2) A beautiful and attractive young woman, in wickedness a 
league beyond the Devil".</p>

<p><br></p>

<h2 class=lrg>Pagan "Conversion"</h2>

<p><img src="img/pg_hndfst01k.jpg" alt="Handfasting Ceremony" class=mrg>
A large portion of the Pagan community admits to finding Paganism  
largely by accident, often by reading or being exposed to unusual 
material. The majority settle in as solo practitioners rather than 
joining a Pagan community, not because they reject community, but 
that's just what they are comfortable with. They do, however, tend 
to keep in communication with other Pagans. The solo practitioners 
are a sort of cloud in which the Pagan communities are embedded.</p>

<p>Pagans generally do not proselytize, but are happy to make 
information available to anyone interested. Most Pagan groups will 
gladly welcome persons who are curious about their beliefs and 
practices (which never include baby eating). Most groups don't 
advertise, and are found by accident, or through friends.</p>

<p>To join a Pagan community, there are usually some simple 
qualifications. Usually they include respect for the natural world 
and environment, acceptance of both the masculine and feminine in 
Divinity, and a high standard of morality, particularly in the 
desire to avoid harming others. Acceptance of folks of all nations, 
races and sexual orientation is almost always included.</p>

<p>For very group ritual oriented groups, being fully accepted is 
gradual. Personalities being in tune with each other is a serious 
issue for these groups, and neither side should be in a hurry.</p>

<p>Becoming a Pagan does not require cutting off your familiar 
community "cold turkey". You are entering a larger realm, which 
envelopes many viewpoints and practices. You will realize the 
religion from which you come is a sect of more limited understanding, 
but probably not completely wrong.</p>

<p>Taking a broad view, there is only one reality, thus all religions 
are aspects of the one. Unfortunately, some of these aspects consider 
themselves to be the "One and Only True Way", thus all others are 
wrong and need to be "corrected", by conversion or death. This has 
caused an inordinate amount of human suffering.</p>

<p>Pagans maintaining "dual citizenship" with a former religion are 
fairly common, and this should be respected. Some Pagans take a "mix 
and match" attitude, drawing from more than one path. This is like 
many ethnic groups that cheerfully mix their native beliefs and 
practices with Christianity or Buddhism after conversion.</p> 

<p>Accepting Paganism can be easier for Christians than for some 
religions, because there is so much that will seem familiar. The New 
Testament embodies concepts that appear influenced by Pagan movements 
of the time, particularly Roman Mithraism (not closely related to 
Persian Mithraism) and the cult of Isis and Osiris.</p>

<p>The early Christian churches absorbed a great deal of material 
from the Pagans. Some local gods and goddesses were adopted as saints, 
and the system of saints roughly followed the Pagan format. Mary became 
the new Vesta, Rome's favorite goddess. Pagan festivals were adopted 
with some adjustments. With Easter, they didn't even bother to change 
the name or remove the symbols of the fertility goddess, the bunny and 
the egg. Christmas has now reverted to something rather similar to the 
Roman Saturnalia. "The Christians took this celebration from us, but 
in the end, the Pagans won." Of course, the Christians got some of the 
dates a little off, but, whatever.</p>

<p>One path within contemporary Paganism is 
<a href="CrPagan01.html">
<b>Christo-Paganism</b></a>, where the person's primary deity is Jesus, 
but practices and attitude are similar to other Pagans. Their Jesus has 
a name, definition and story, just like other Deities. Some Pagans have 
a bad reaction to this, understandably, as many are refugees from the 
Christian Churches, many from the "fire and brimstone" Evangelical 
Churches.</p>

<p>If the legitimacy of other Deities and other practices are fully 
accepted, this Jesus could find a legitimate place within the Pagan 
pantheon. A former Jesuit, who studied the issue intensively, wrote that 
it might be possible to follow the teachings of Jesus as a Pagan, but 
not as a Christian, as the teachings of Christianity are incompatible 
with Jesus' teachings. On the other hand, adapting Jesus to Paganism is 
not an easy matter, as fully described on our page 
<a href="CrPagan01.html">
<b>Jesus &amp; Paganism</b></a>.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="caland" class=lrg>The Pagan Calendar</h2>

<p><img src="img/pg_maya01c.jpg" alt="Mayan Calendar" class=mrg>
Paganism is closely tied to the Earth, and to the cycles of nature, 
thus it is very seasonal. This cyclic nature is carried forward to many 
other aspects of nature and human life. Most early Pagan cultures had 
major celebrations at solstices and equinoxes, and some of the 
cross-quarter days between, but none are known to have celebrated all 
of them.</p>

<p>The wheel below (to the left or top) represents the seasonal festivals 
established by the 20th century Wiccan and Druidry movements in England. 
The names are from Celtic and Anglo-Saxon, but the modern celebrations 
may not follow actual practices of those peoples. This wheel has been 
widely accepted, with names in different languages, by other Pagan groups 
across Europe, promoting some consistency among different practices.</p>

<p>For Wiccans, the cross-quarter celebrations are the "Greater Sabbats", 
which follows from the Celtic New Year being <b>Samhain</b> (say 
"Sowhain", the Celts just got the "w" upside down). The Celts didn't 
celebrate <b>Mabon</b> and had no Celtic name for it. Somebody just 
named it after a Celtic hero. This has been controversial, because 
Mabon didn't have any association with the season, but nobody has 
come up with a widely accepted alternative. Some just use Fallfest, 
derived from the Heathen wheel.</p>

<p>Note that the Wiccan day starts at sundown of the previous day, so 
May 1st starts on the evening of April 30th, but for convenience, most 
Wiccans use the Gregorian calendar dates. It should be noted that 
Wiccans also have a lunar schedule of less formal Esbat gatherings, but 
these are not included by Pagan groups less attuned to the Lunar cycle.
</p>

<p>Pagan communities in different regions also have their own special 
festivals scattered about the year. The second wheel (right or bottom), 
showing some additional festivals, is from the Heathenism movement in 
German speaking regions of Europe. For Pagans in the Southern Hemisphere 
(particularly Australia and New Zealand) the seasonal wheel is rotated 
6 months so it coincides with the actual seasons in that region. 
Conveniently, not many European Pagans live along the equator.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Midwinter / Yule:</b> &nbsp; This Winter Solstice celebration 
has been in practice from at least Neolithic times. It represents the 
rebirth of the Sun, from a period of declining light to a period of 
increasing light, and for the Wiccans the rebirth of the god. Christians 
adopted it as the time of the birth of Christ, though that date is at 
odds with other aspects of the nativity story. They also adopted many 
Pagan customs, such as the Yule Log, bringing in evergreen boughs, tree 
decorating, use of holly and mistletoe, and gift giving. To the Germans 
and Romans, this was the most important festival of the year.<p></p></li>

<li><b>Imbolc:</b> &nbsp; This first cross-quarter festival was important 
as the first stirrings of Spring. To the Celts it was the time when the 
ewes started to produce milk in preparation for birthing spring lambs. 
It was also celebrated in Scandinavia as the D&iacute;sabl&oacute;t, 
still represented in Sweden by an annual spring fair. To Celtic Pagans 
it was dedicated to the fertility goddess Brigid, whom the Christians 
apparently adopted as Saint Brigid, retaining some of the characteristics 
of the goddess. The Christians adopted this festival as Candlemas, the 
time when Jesus was presented at the temple. Imbolc is the time to start 
spring cleaning.<p></p></li> 

<li><b>Ostara:</b> &nbsp; the Spring Equinox festival, celebrating the 
successful rebirth of nature. In Anglo-Saxon regions It is dedicated to 
the fertility goddess Eostre, and in other regions to similar fertility 
goddess under other names. It was adopted by the Christians as the time 
of the resurrection of Christ. The name Ostara was retained as Easter, 
as were the bunny and the egg, symbols of the goddess.<p></p></li>

<li><b>Beltane:</b> &nbsp; The May Day cross-quarter festival is the 
second most important festival to the Wiccans. The Romans dedicated it 
to Flora, goddess of flowers. In Ireland it marked the first day of 
Summer. Due to its very strong Pagan associations, the Christians did 
not adopt this as a significant festival, but it continued on with 
secularized versions of Pagan practices, including Maypole Dancing 
and crowning of the Queen of the May with plenty of flowers. The 
ancient Celts held an important bonfire festival on the night leading 
to May Day. This coincides with Walpurgis Nacht festivals in Germanic 
countries.<p></p></li>

<li><b>Midsummer / Litha:</b> &nbsp; The Summer Solstice has been 
celebrated since Neolithic times and was particularly important thorough 
northern Europe, from the British Isles on through Russia. It is still a 
public holiday in some European countries. The Romans dedicated it to 
Summanus, a thunder god once more important than Jupiter. The Christians 
adopted it as St. John's Day, celebrating the birth of St. John the 
Baptist (actual birthday unknown). Some Christian sects consider 
St. John more important than Jesus.<p></p></li>

<li><b>Lammas / Lughnasadh:</b> &nbsp; This cross-quarter festival has 
long marked the beginning of the wheat harvest in Anglo-Saxon England 
and in Ireland. This is the first of the three traditional harvest 
festivals, and time to start baking bread for the winter.<p></p></li>

<li><b>Mabon:</b> &nbsp; The Autumnal Equinox is the second of the 
Autumn Harvest Festivals. The name "Mabon" was assigned by Wiccans 
around 1970, named for a character in Welsh mythology. It is less 
important to Wiccans and to most other Pagan groups than the other 
festivals. It has no strong ancient Pagan precedent and has not been 
appropriated by the Christians for anything important.<p></p></li>

<li><b>Samhain:</b> &nbsp; (Pronounced "Sowane", the Celts just got 
the "w" upside down) In Celtic times this was the beginning of the 
New Year, and it is the most important Wiccan celebration, marking 
the death of the god. It marks the end of the harvest and the time 
cattle were brought down from summer pasture. It was also the time of 
slaughter of animals that couldn't be maintained through the winter, 
and preservation of their meat by drying, salting and smoking. It is 
also considered a time when the veil separating this world from the 
Otherworld (realm of the gods, spirits and the dead) is weakest and 
can be most easily crossed. The Christians, unable to make this most 
Pagan of celebration go away, repositioned All Saint's Day and All 
Souls Day here. This all merged together as the modern Halloween.</li>

<h2 id="astrol">Astrology</h2>

<p><img src="img/pg_astzod01c.jpg" alt="Medieval Vienese Zodiac" class=mrg>
Science has done its best to discredit Astrology, but it remains important 
in many cultures. Western Astrology is based on the path of the Sun, the 
circle of the Seasons, and how they relate to human development, physical 
and spiritual. The actual constellations of fixed stars after which the Signs 
are named, have no significance at all, and are, by now, quite out of 
alignment with the Astrological Signs.</p>

<p>It should be noted that understanding Astorology, or belief in Astrology, 
are not at all a requirement of Paganism. Many Pagans pay no attention to 
it at all in their practices.</p>

<p>At the very least, Astrology is a complex and powerful symbolic language 
describing the path of a human through life, and the influences encountered. 
This language can be useful, and is used, in meditation, psychology, ritual, 
and magic. This symbolic language is deeply involved with the 
<a href="Pagan01.html#caland"><b>Calendar</b></a> and the <a href="Pagan01.html#elem"><b>Elemental 
Realms</b></a>.</p>

<p>Another concept is that it is a system of thought entities, created and 
reinforced in their meanings through the ages by practitioners, until they 
are powerful enough to actually influence our lives. They are symbolized by 
the planets, and assigned to them, but are not at all of the physical realm.
</p>

<p>If you wish to understand this symbolic language, to any depth you wish, 
even if just to be conversent, I suggest you read Ivo Dominguez Jr's book 
<i> Practical Astrology for Witches and Pagans</i>. It is clear, 
organized, comprehensive, and even logical.<p>

<p>Of course, Astrology is still quite active as a pop-culture toy. It should 
also be noted that Hindu Astrology, still very influential in India, uses the 
same signs, probably brought from Greece, but they are adjusted to be kept in 
alignment with the original constellations. This means the language, methods, 
and calculations of Hindu Astrology (sidereal Astrology) are different from 
those of Western Astrology (tropical Astrology).
<br class=cll></p>


   
<p><br></p>

<h2 class=lrg id="elem">The Elemental Realms</h2>

<p>The traditional four elements are totally different concepts from the 
"elements" of Science - they just go by the same name. They are valid and 
useful concepts, particularly for personal development, rituals, and magic. 
They are all considered supportive, transformative and essential to life 
itself, and central to most Pagan rituals and celebrations.</p>

<h2>Fire</h2>

<p><img src="img/pg_fire01s.jpg" alt="Ritual Fire" class=mrg>
Fires, ranging from candles to bonfires, are almost universal in 
Pagan practices. The smoke from fires is expected to carry prayers 
to the gods. Fire alters are common in a number of traditions, and 
are important in the seasonal celebrations.<p>

<p>This is a natural thing, given the central place of fire in the 
development of humanity. Paleoanthropologists have found evidence that 
fire was already in use by our last pre-human ancestors. They believe 
the use of fire to cook foods was what enabled development of the 
large brains we enjoy today. Brains are very energy costly and 
difficult to maintain on a raw foods diet.</p>

<p>Fire was also critical for protection from predators, for keeping 
warm during ice ages, and for crafts. Very early humans were already 
using fire to condition flint to make better, sharper blades. Later 
it was used to fire pottery and melt metals. Most Pagan rituals and 
ceremonies use Fire as a tool.</p>

<p>Using fire as protection from predators proved very important in 
human development. It allowed safe sleep on the ground, which made 
profound changes in the human sleep cycle. One result was the ability 
to organize much larger communities.</p>

<p>In Magic, fire is usually represented by, well, fire, but in the 
Tarot, or in the hands of a Sourcerer, and most Ceremonial Leaders, it 
is a Wand, perhaps originally representing a torch, or the fire of growing 
things. In Gardenarian Wicca, fire is represented by the Sword or Athame 
(ceremonial knife), used for Air in other practices. I consider this a 
serious error, but Gardener was really into knives.</p>

<h2>Water</h2>

<p><img src="img/pg_cup02s.jpg" alt="Cup of Water" class=mrg>
All life on Earth originated in the sea, and in most Pagan traditions 
the world started with a rising of land from a primordial sea, by one 
means or another. We are all still creatures of the sea, but carry the 
salt sea within us - our blood and other fluids.<p>

<p>In Magic and the Tarot, the symbol for Water is the cup, chalice or 
caldron. Water is considered very transfomative and important in 
cleansing and initiations (for instance, Christian baptism). Bodies of 
water have always been associated with important spirits, gods and 
goddesses, and magical workings. In many workings it represents the 
realm of love.</p>

<p>Aside from its use in almost all cleansing and transformation 
rituals, Water is also a carrier for the ingredients in potions of 
all sorts, magical and other.</p>
 

<h2>Air</h2>

<p><img src="img/pg_sword01s.jpg" alt="Sword" class=mrg>
Air is the very breath of life, without which our lives and the lives 
of all the creatures of the Earth would be impossible. Even the creatures 
of the sea depend on air dissolved in the water.</p>

<p>In the cycle of Air, plants take in carbon dioxide, break it down, 
and breath out oxygen. Animals take in oxygen, combine it with fuels 
and breath out carbon dioxide. The process is far more complex, but that 
will suffice to show the interdependency of plants and animals.</p>

<p>In Magic, and the Tarot, the symbol for Air is the sword. Another 
working tool in the realm of air is feathers, or even whole wings - 
gifts from the creatures of air. The exception is Gardenarian Wicca, 
where the Sword (or Athame) represents Fire, so they use incense as 
the symbol for Air.</p>

<p>Air represents intellect, observation, analysis and the scientific 
method, thus the sword image, the cutting edge. It also represents 
communication, between people and to the other entities, through 
sound  - and hopefully not by the sword.</p> 

<h2>Earth</h2>

<p><img src="img/pent002s.jpg" alt="Earth Pentacle" class=mrg>
Earth is the mother of all living things. We are born from the 
Earth and to the earth we will return, despite attempts at preserving 
the dead - the Earth abides, and will claim them at last. </p> 

<p>Earth nourishes all living things. Even creatures of the sea depend 
on nourishment washed down from the land. The progression of seasons 
is of vital importance - though many in North America are removed from 
it, it is nonetheless critical to their survival.</p> 

<p>In earlier times, people were much closer to the seasons and 
their effect on life - thus the extreme importance of the seasonal 
celebrations and rituals in all Pagan practices. A poor harvest was 
a disaster - even conquering armies could not march if the harvest 
had not been good. Most Pagan rituals and celebrations involving 
Earth are in the nature of giving thanks.</p>

<p>In Magic, Earth is represented by salt, crystals or stones. In tarot, 
Pentacles is the suite of Earth, or in some decks, coins.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="drugs" class=lrg>Mind Altering Substances</h2>

<p><img src="img/fu_amanita01c.jpg" alt="Amanita Mushroom" class=mrg>
Natural mind altering substances have been used in religious 
practices since the beginning of humanity, usually to provide a gateway 
into other realms. Use of the stronger substances was generally by 
shamanic specialists, but sometimes within larger groups.</p>

<p>Due to location and dating of recent finds, archaeologists have come 
to suspect the first settled agricultural communities were established 
at ceremonial sites, to provide a reliable supply of beer and wine for 
the seasonal rituals and celebrations. A 6100 year old wine making 
operation recently found in Armenia is of such sophistication as to
clearly show it was not a new invention. It is associated with a burial 
ground.</p>

<p>Today, natural psychedelics are used mainly by non-European native 
practices, and still usually by specialists or under their supervision. 
Beer, and particularly wine, are quite common enhancements to ritual 
and celebration for nearly all Pagan practices of European descent, 
and wine is even important to some Christian practices.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="food" class=lrg>Food</h2>

<p><a href="Thanks01.html">
<img src="img/cb_cabm01c.jpg" alt="Mix of Cabbages" class=mrg></a>
Pagans are very serious about food. It is a major connection between ouselves 
and the Earth. Food should be in as close to a natural state as is practical, 
but most should be cooked. Our pre-human ancestors learned to control fire and 
cook food, bringing the high nutrition that made us possible.</p>

<p>Unnatural foods should be rejected as damaging to our bodies and to the 
Earth. Preparing food should be done with conscious care, as a sacrament 
honoring the Earth, and honoring our very distant ancestors who's fires 
enabled us. It should be considered an art, not a labor.</p>

<p>Many Pagans are vegetarians, as part of their desire to be shepherds of 
the Earth, honoring all living creatures. On the other hand, we are of the 
animal kind, and have no choice but to live by taking life from other beings. 
Plants too have awareness.</p>

<p>We must constantly express our thanks for the nourishment we receive, 
and give thanks directly to the beings we take that nourishment from, not 
to a remote mythical third party in the sky. Here I have posted a simple 
ritual of thanks, to be recited silently or voiced: 
<a href="Thanks01.html"><b>Thanking for Sustenance</b></a>. &nbsp; If some 
cynical Christian, knowing you are Pagan, asks you to say grace at 
Thanksgiving, they will be surprised - use the Group Leaders version so 
they are included.</p>

<p>Food is also a very important factor in Community, a major aspect in some 
modes of Paganism. This also includes Hospitality, Charity, and offerings 
to Gods, Goddesses, Ancestors and assorted spririts. Animal sacrifices and 
burnt offerings, however, are not features of contermporary Paganism.</p>

<p>Of course, this site,  <a href="../index.html"><b>Clovegarden.com</b></a> 
is primarily about food, but for a lot more on the relationship between 
food and Paganism, see Gwion Raven's book <i><b>The Magick of Food</b></i>.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="sex" class=lrg>Sexuality</h2>

<p><img src="img/pg_sex01c.jpg" alt="Male-Female Sex Symbol" class=mrg>
Sexual reproduction is critically important to the evolution of 
living beings, including animals, plants, fungus, algae, and others. 
Evolution was extremely slow until sexual reproduction developed - 
then it took off like gang busters. In advanced beings, asexual 
reproduction is a one-way street to oblivion. Even with sexual 
reproduction, an insufficiently diverse gene pool is a severe 
disadvantage.</p>

<p>The mechanisms of sexual reproduction are very complex, even among 
plants and animals, but within humanity they are an order of magnitude 
more complex. Sexuality has been put to service far beyond simple 
reproduction, and is a major factor in family and community cohesiveness 
and organization. Naturally, sexuality is prominent in Pagan practices, 
appearing in various forms, especially in the progression of the seasons.
</p>

<p>Human sexuality is very powerful, and rather erratic. Given its 
complexity, there are lots of ways for it to go awry, and we see that 
even among animals. There are many variations, and these variations 
are built into a person's gene structure. They are not by choice, and 
they are not something that can be changed by "reeducation". Pagan 
communities have been in the forefront of accepting the LGBT for what 
they are, people as worthy as any other. Some circles In Dianic Wicca 
are entirely Lesbian, and the all male Radical Faeries are considered 
to fall within the realm of modern Paganism.</p>

<p>Pagan communities tend also to be liberal in regard to normal 
heterosexual activity. On the other hand, Pagans are serious about the 
world's natural environment, and the most pervasive destroyer of that 
environment is overpopulation, so birth control is a serious issue - 
also, there's always that little matter of personal responsibility to 
contend with, and in developed countries, the horrifying expense.</p>

<p>Sexual variations that harm others are in violation of important 
Pagan principles and are intolerable. Sexual behavior between (or among) 
people <u>must</u> be consensual, with all parties aware of how it will 
go, and all with the ability to say "stop". Because human development 
is very slow, we have the concept of "age of consent". Persons below 
that age do not fully comprehend the consequences, so cannot give 
consent, and older guardians are not authorized to speak for them in 
these matters. It's strictly "hands off".</p>

<p><br></p>

<h2 class=lrg id="group">Pagan Groups, Organizations <small>&amp;</small> Publications</h2> 

<p>Despite continuous attacks from Christian organizations and popular 
media equating Paganism with Satanism, Pagan communities are growing in 
size and numbers. In no way can they be characterized as "Satanic". 
Satanic cults are "reversal" offshoots of Christianity and Judaism, not 
at all related to the indigenous pre-Christian religions or to modern 
Paganism.<p>

<p>Few Pagan groups ever proselytize for new members, but are welcoming 
to people who find a home in them. They are usually low key and a 
little difficult for interested people to find. People who have studied 
Pagan communities have noted the membership is generally well educated 
and avid readers, and often find artistic inspiration from Paganism.</p>

<p>It is rather difficult to get good statistics on the number of people 
who consider themselves Pagan, especially since organizations are so 
decentralized, and well over half of Pagans are solo practitioners. There 
is also fear of extreme prejudice from Christians, and even death threats 
(sometimes carried out) from Muslims. Some numbers have been compiled for 
English speaking regions:</p>
 <ul>
 <li><b>England:</b> &nbsp; 42,262 by 2006 census, up to 250,000 by other 
   estimates.</li>
 <li><b>Ireland:</b> &nbsp; 2000 to 3000, estimated.</li>
 <li><b>Canada:</b> &nbsp; 21,080 by 2001 census.</li>
 <li><b>United States:</b> &nbsp;  over 1,000,000 by estimate from 
   Pew Research, based on extensive polling.</li>
 <li><b>Australia:</b> &nbsp; 32,083 by 2011 census.</li>
 <li><b>New Zealand:</b> &nbsp; 6,804 by 2006 census.</li>
 </ul>

<p>Wikipedia maintains a 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Neopagan_movements">
<b>List of Neopagan Movements</b></a> with links briefly describing 
well known organizations. Of course, for such a decentralized movement 
there are a great many small groups which may or may not be associated 
with the listed groups.</p>

<p>Nearly all Pagan communities are peaceful, entirely harmless and 
welcoming, but there are a few exceptions. In German speaking Europe  
there is some revival of the German Occultism that contributed to Nazi 
mythology and anti-semitism, and there are some Neo-Nazi groups that 
hide themselves by pretending to be Heathen religious groups. There 
is also Wotanism (Wotansvolk) in North America, which is very popular 
among White Supremacists in prison populations. These are dangerous 
groups to be avoided.</p>

<h3>Pagan Federation International</h3></a>
<p>The <i>Pagan Federation</i> (PF) was started in the UK in 1971 to 
distribute information and protect the rights of Pagans. It was primarily 
of Wiccan origin. Some members were in other countries, so the <i>Pagan 
Federation International</i> was eventually formed to better serve them. 
This organization was greatly enabled by the rise of the Internet, and 
broadened to cover many forms of Paganism. In 2006 PFI became the 
foundation "Stichting Pagan Federation International", registered in 
The Hague, Netherlands, #27282660. Legal Separation from PF was complete 
and the two are now "affiliate organizations". PFI has branches in at 
least 35 countries and all permanently inhabited continents. The PF has 
been freed to retain its very UK and Wicca orientation. It publishes a 
substantial quarterly magazine, <i>Pagan Dawn</i>, now in its 45th year, 
which the PFI makes available to members at additional cost.
<br class=cll></p>
<p>The mission of PFI is simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>To promote and defend the rights of Pagans.</li>
<li>To support the rights of Pagans to worship freely and without 
  censure, regardless of their race, gender, nationality or cultural 
  background.</li>
</ul>
<p>The principles of the organization are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Love for and Kinship with Nature. Reverence for the life force and 
  its ever-renewing cycles of life and death.</li>
<li>A positive morality, in which the individual is responsible for the 
  discovery and development of their true nature in harmony with the 
  outer world and community. This is often expressed as "Do what you 
  will, as long as it harms none".</li>
<li>Recognition of the Divine, which transcends gender, acknowledging 
  both the female and male aspect of Deity.</li>
</ol>

<br>The <a href="http://www.paganpride.org/home">
<h3>Pagan Pride Project</h3></a> Sponsors festivals and fairs in various 
locations around the United States, Canada, Latin America, and Europe. 
This is an inclusive organization and all manner of pagans are welcome.
The sponsored events vary widely by location, but usually feature 
lectures, demonstration ceremonies, and a wide array of vendor booths. 
Sometimes additional entertainment is provided by Christian protestors. 
These events are put on by more or less independent regional 
organizations, so some events are quite regular, and others are quite 
erratic. They vary from modest picnics to larger events like the 2019 
<a href="http://www.paganpridela.org/">Los Angeles and Orange County</a> 
event, featuring about 57 vendor booths and many workshops and rituals. 
It was well attended and there were no protestors. The Pagan Pride Web 
site provides dates and locations for upcoming events.

<p>Goal:
<br>The organization aims, through education, activism, charity and 
community, to promote tolerance and understanding among people with 
different belief systems. For Pagans, the project aims to help them 
find pride and confidence in their chosen path. For non-Pagans, the 
project aims to help in understanding Pagan friends, coworkers and 
family members.</p>

<h3>European Congress of Ethnic Religions</h3></a>
<p>Where the PFI is quite liberal, as you would expect from it's 
Wiccan roots, the ECER is hard core reconstructionist. This organization 
was formed in 1998 in Vilnius, Lithuania as the "World Congress of 
Ethnic Religions". Founding organizations were from Lithuania, Poland, 
Denmark and Belgium.  The name was changed in 2010 to "European Congress 
of Ethnic Religions" to reflect reality, though it does maintain ties to 
Hinduism and has held two annual meetings in India.</p>

<p>Goal:</p>
<ul>
<li>The purpose of the ECER is to serve as an international body that 
  will assist Ethnic Religious groups in various countries and will 
  oppose discrimination against such groups.</li>
<li>By Ethnic Religion, we mean religion, spirituality, and cosmology 
  that is firmly grounded in a particular people's traditions. In our 
  view, this does not include modern occult or ariosophic 
  theories/ideologies, nor syncretic neo-religions.</li>

<h3>Church of the Eternal Source</h3></a>
<p>Devoted to reconstruction of the Ancient Egyptian religion, CES is 
the oldest non-profit Kemetic organization. Established in California 
in 1970 and granted non-profit status in 1971, it describes itself as 
a "A Federation of Neo-Egyptian Reconstruction Temples". This reflects 
its non-centralized structure.</p>
<p>After the last of the founders died in 2010, the Church went dormant 
through a period of evaluation and reconsideration. As of August 2017 
it has returned to the public realm. Under the guidance of Dr. Michael 
Poe, it plans to post about 1800 documents regarding Egyptian religion 
on its Web sites, and to begin an on-line religious training program.

<h3>Circle Sanctuary</h3></a>
<p>This extremely important organization was founded in 1974 by 
Celina Fox. While sometimes classed as Wiccan, it has a much broader 
appeal and describes itself as a Nature Spirituality church. It has 
been at the very forefront of the struggle to preserve the rights of 
Pagans and end discrimination, through political and legal means, 
including a long battle to get the Veterans Administration to approve 
the Pentacle symbol for veteran grave markers. The group is based 
in a 200 acre nature preserve in southwest Wisconsin, USA. It holds 
festivals and produces a magazine and other publications. Definitely 
worth supporting. </p>

I am a largely Non-Theist Pagan, but have recently been doing some work 
with Freya, who seems to be branching out from her Germanic roots - 
note her very India style pose and Japanese companion (Shinto I presume). 
It's all OK, since Vedic Hinduism originated from the same Proto 
Indo-European root as Germanic Paganism.</p>
