<hr class=hr2>
<p>
<span class=tf>"The real question is not 'Can one be a Pagan and revere 
Jesus?', but rather 'Can one follow the teachings of Jesus and also be 
a Christian?'"</span></p>

<p>These are the words of a former Jesuit, Robert Barzan, who had studied 
the issues intensively. He continues that the teachings of Jesus are not 
compatible with the teachings of Christianity, but that it may be possible 
to follow Jesus' teachings and also be a Pagan.</p>

<p>There are persons today who wish to escape the churches, but bring 
Jesus with them into the Pagan fold. They are called "Christo-Pagans", 
and are understandably met with resistance. If Jesus was the Jesus of 
children's Sunday school, it would be easy, but that is not the Jesus 
of the gospels.</p>

<p>This page explores the problems between Jesus and Paganism, and the 
theological adjustments that must be made - but this page can also be 
helpful to Christians in understanding how Christianity contrasts with 
Paganism, other religions, and with Jesus.</p>

<p>Speaking of adjustment, the 4th century catacomb mural in the photo 
to the left, is the earliest known representations of Jesus with a 
beard. He was commonly without a beard even into the 6th century.

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Judaism is totally incompatible with any form of Paganism, and 
Christianity is not much more compatible. Some folks claim to be both 
Pagan and Christian, but they are probably making serious compromises - 
cherry picking from both sides.</p>

<p>To carry Jesus into Paganism, Christianity, and Judaism, must be 
stripped away from him. That is easier than you might think, because 
the teachings of Jesus are incompatible with Christianity. There are 
still issues between the teachings of Jesus and Paganism, which we 
explore in the paragraphs below.</p>

<p>Paganism, for this discussion, includes the many forms that are 
today called "Neo-Paganism". Even the most hard core Pagan 
reconstructionists admit adaptions must be made, because our times are 
very different from ancient Pagan times. The only uninterrupted Pagan 
culture is in Ossetia, in southern Russia, though some traditions were 
preserved in Abkhazia. The descriptions here of Pagan attitudes are 
not without exception, but predominate in the Neo-Pagan movement.</p>

<p>For a better understanding of Paganism, see our article 
<a href="Pagan01.html"><b>A Pagan Reality - In Our Time</b></a>. 
I also strongly recommend the book <b>Godless Paganism - voices of 
Non-Theistic Pagans</b>. Most of the concepts expressed in the book 
are also valid for theistic Pagans. It is available from Lulu and 
Amazon.</p>

<p>Many Pagans and Witches of today are refugees from the Christian 
churches, many from the extreme "fire and brimstone" Evangelical 
churches. They have come with strong prejudice against Jesus, whom 
they associate with the churches that claim to represent him. The 
churches lie, they do not represent Jesus, they exploit him.</p>

<p>Many Evangelical churches recently (2016) preached from their pulpits, 
in total violation of their tax-free status, that their flock MUST vote 
for Donald Trump, because "<u>God</u> has sent Donald Trump to be 
<u>King of America</u>". Donald Trump <u>EXEMPLIFIES</u> nearly 
everything Jesus taught <u>AGAINST</u>. There is simply <u>no</u> 
relationship between these churches and the teachings of Jesus, and 
not a lot among many other "Christian" churches.<p>

<p>Christianity was spread by conquest and mob violence - "Conversion by 
the sword" was not invented by the Muslims. Christianity was promoted 
by emperors and kings who loved the idea of one all-powerful God, who 
awarded them unquestionable powers by "Divine Right". Millions were 
slaughtered by the kings and the churches. It is difficult to convince 
many Pagans that Jesus was not a party to these atrocities, all done in 
his name.</p>

<p>How could Christianity have drifted so far from the teachings of 
Jesus? Well, it wasn't a drift. Subverting the teachings of Jesus was 
integral to the very foundation of the Christian churches. It was 
placed into their DNA by the man who founded them. For details, 
see our page <a href="Paul01.html"><b>Jesus Betrayed</b></a>.

<p>Christian hypocrisy is a major reason mainstream Protestantism has 
been plunging in the polls, with a corresponding rise in "spiritual 
but not religious". Paganism is also increasing, and it is estimated 
there are now more Pagans than Presbyterians. The Evangelical churches 
have held fairly steady, but are expected to plunge in the next few 
years. The average membership is very advanced in age, and the young 
are leaving.</p>

<p>While it is easy to see the disconnect between Christianity and 
and the teachings of Jesus, there is still incompatibility between 
Jesus and modern Paganism. This is explained in detail in the 
paragraphs below. A Christo-Pagan must reconcile these issues.</p>
<hr class=hr2s>
<br>

<h2>Historical Jesus</h2>

<p><img src="img/Jesus02c.jpg" alt="Jesus Mosaic" class=mrg>
The search for the historical Jesus is over. There is no shred of 
hard evidence Jesus was a living person. Various places in his life have 
been appointed without actual evidence. Origen, perhaps the greatest 
theologian of early Christianity, during his exile in the Holy Land 
(around 233 CE), set out to identify all the places in the story of Jesus. 
He admitted he could find nothing. None of the many recent attempts to 
present the "historical Jesus" have been at all convincing - there are 
just too few bits and pieces to construct a person out of. Nonetheless, 
there is consensus that he was a real person, so we go along with that 
here.</p>

<p>For the nature of Jesus, we must depend on what was written as close 
to his time as is available. Most is from the four canonical gospels, 
but also from other Christian sources, some of which were heavily 
suppressed by the church. There are no non-Christian references to 
Jesus by name until about 80 years after his birth.</p>

<p>The canonical Gospels were written between 66 and 110 CE, and 
scholars do not believe any of them were written by eye witnesses 
to Jesus' life. There may have been documents available to the Gospel 
writers that were from eye witnesses, but none of them exist today. 
There are a few fragments of other documents from this period, but 
nearly all other Christian sources are later than 110 CE, many are 
hundreds of years later. For much more on the writing of the Gospels, 
see our Appendix, <a href="CrPagan01.html#gosp"><b>The Gospels</b></a>.
</p>

<p>Despite centuries of effort by Christian theologians to "de-Judafy" 
Jesus, he was totally Jewish, lived in the Jewish communities, and was 
only interested in preaching to Jews. This has been strongly supported 
by recent scholarship and archaeology. When he sent his disciples out 
to teach and to heal, he specifically told them not to minister to 
the Gentiles or the Samaritans (an offshoot of Judaism) [Mat X 5].  
Teaching to Gentiles was initiated by Peter, and Paul eventually 
ministered to Gentiles almost exclusively This did not sit well with 
some others in the movement.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2>God and the Old Testament</h2>

<p><img src="img/God01c.jpg" alt="Emanation of Light" class=mrg>
The angry, vengeful, jealous God of the Jewish scriptures, made in 
the image of kings, is totally unacceptable to Paganism. Many feel the 
Old Testament itself has little place in Christianity. Its adoption by 
the churches was critical to justify an authoritarian church, which 
was not directly supported by the teachings of Jesus.</p>

<p>Jesus' concept of God may have been a little different from the 
Old Testament, but the Gospels provide little evidence of that. He 
seems to presume the image of God is well established in the community 
he taught to, and his words do imply love, but also a dash of 
vengefulness.</p>

<p>References to passages in the Old Testament are common in the gospels. 
There were no other references that would be familiar to the people early 
Christians were preaching to, and the early Christians were very strongly 
trying to maintain their Jewish identity. This became more difficult 
when Jews accepting Jesus as the Messiah were banned from the synagogues, 
and the movement became increasingly dominated by Gentiles.</p>

<p>Even with these references, there is no reason for wholesale adoption 
of the Old Testament into Christianity except that it provided for 
authoritarian kings and church hierarchies. These authoritarian 
structures were not supported by the teachings of Jesus, so had to 
be derived from some other authority.</p>

<h2>One Path to Salvation</h2>

<p><img src="img/Jesus01c.jpg" alt="Jesus" class=mrg>
Jesus, in the Gospels, makes it quite clear that he stands between 
you and God, and that only through him can you find salvation. He alone 
judges your worthiness and speaks to God on your behalf - for salvation 
or for condemnation. This is made very clear in John V 22-23, which 
states that the Father does not judge anyone but has given over judgement 
entirely to the Son, and that all should be honoring the Son just as 
they honor the Father. Further, anyone who does not honor the Son also 
does not honor the Father who sent Him.</p>

<p>This is not compatible with Paganism. Paganism strongly holds 
to personal responsibility, and to direct communication by you with 
spiritual entities, however you conceive of them. It is your own 
responsibility to improve yourself. In the end, you will be judged 
on how well you played the cards life dealt you. As the saying goes, 
"Karma is a bitch", but Pagans do not believe in eternal torture as 
a result of this one lifetime.</p>

<p>And, while we're talking about forgiveness - John 3:16 says, 
"Whosoever believeth in him, may not perish, but may have life 
everlasting". Problem: Jesus states he requires proof of that 
belief - the proof being whether you lived in accordance with his 
teachings. This is something a whole lot who claim to be 
Christians will have a hard time providing. The "Hell of Fire" 
is going to be pretty crowded.</p>

<p>Be aware that Jesus said nothing about his crucifixion washing
away your sins, nor do the gospels say that anywhere. That the blood 
sacrifice of Jesus was to relieve you of all responsibility for your 
sins never made much sense, and was all made up by the apostle Paul, 
for his own purposes.
<br class=cll></p>
<br>

<h2 id="gender">Gender Issues</h2>

<p><img src="img/hetero01c.jpg" alt="Heterosexual Symbol" class=mrg>
Paganism, in all its many forms, theist and non-theist alike, is 
overwhelmingly gender balanced. If there is bias, it is usually to 
the female side, because so many Pagans are women refugees from the 
paternalism of the churches. Pagans predominantly follow scientific 
evidence that gender identity is not a "choice", and most respect all 
gender identities, including transgender folks. There are exceptions, 
such as Dianic Wicca, which admits only natural born women, preferably 
lesbians, and recognize only a goddess.</p>

<p>All this brings a very major disconnect with Christianity and Judaism, 
but a lesser disconnect with the teachings of Jesus.</p> 

<p>Many centuries before Jesus, Judaism gradually suppressed, then 
completely removed God's wife, forbidding her very name to be spoken. 
With no female deity to fear, the Jewish hierarchy relegated women to 
a status somewhere between men and livestock. In those days, women were 
considered to be failed men, fetuses that had not developed fully before 
birth.</p>

<p>Most scholars hold that Jesus did not consider women fully equal 
to men, but Jesus included many women in his circle, especially Mary 
Magdalene. It is recorded that his apostles strongly protested these  
inclusions. In the Gospel of Thomas, Jesus tells the complainers that 
in heaven he will convert these women to men, so they can enjoy the 
benefits. There is some evidence the very early church treated men 
and women more or less equally, but with Jesus gone, the leaders of 
Christianity relegated women to their place as assigned in Judaism.<p>

<p>The apostle Paul, who founded the Christian Churches, despised women, 
and decreed for them total subjugation under their husbands, and for 
total silence in the churches. It is interesting to note that by Roman 
law a woman was never under legal control of her husband. She was legally 
bound to her father, and when he died she was legally independent.</p>

<p>Paul's paternalistic suppression of women is still strong in the 
Christianity of our time. Example: one of the greatest influences within 
the Medieval church was Hildegard von Bengen, yet it took over 830 years 
and a sneaky Pope to get her canonized as a saint - he used a loophole 
in ecclesiastic law to do it. Belief is still strong in the church 
hierarchy that no woman could possibly have accomplished all the things 
she accomplished without the help of the Devil.</p>

<p>The one exception to suppression of the female was the elevation of 
Mary, as a tool of deception. To attract Roman converts, the early 
church constituted Mary in the image of Vesta, Rome's favorite goddess. 
They dressed her in blue, Vesta's color, and had her ride on a Donkey, 
Vesta's favorite animal. Casting her in this pseudo-Pagan mode turned 
out all too successful, as veneration of the Madonna reached Pagan 
goddess levels, especially in Spain.</p>

<p>One of the major goals of the Protestant Reformation was to get rid 
of Mary, and she plays an extremely minor roll in Protestantism today. 
Her role in the Catholic Church has also been greatly diminished.</p> 

<p><img src="img/pg_Sophia08h.jpg" alt="Sophia" class=mrg>
To bring Jesus into the Pagan fold, all this gender crap has to be 
discarded. Christo-Pagans <u>must</u> clearly recognize the equality 
of male and female in deity, or they cannot be respected as Pagans.</p>

<p>For Jesus the man, there is Mary Magdalene. She was not a repentant 
prostitute - that was made up hundreds of years later as part of the 
suppression of women. She was a well to do Jewish lady who supported 
Jesus' ministry with her own resources. A radical synagogue has now 
been excavated in Magdala where Jesus would probably have been welcome 
to preach, and where he could have met Mary Magdalene.</p>

<p>For the esoteric aspects of Jesus, there is Sophia. Of Greek 
origin, as personification of wisdom, Sophia has long been adopted by 
the Gnostic Christian Church as the feminine side of Jesus. Gnostic 
theology is very complex, so we won't dive into it here, but a 
Christo-Pagan should definitely consider honoring Sofia.
<br class=cll></p>
<br>

<h2>Proselytizing</h2>

<p><img src="img/hell02k.jpg" alt="Hell" class=mrg>
In his teachings, Jesus promises salvation to those who repent, follow 
his teachings, and have faith in him. These promises are always 
backed by threats of eternal torture should you fail to do so. These 
threats are to be enforced by his father, God, and the dirty work is 
to be done by the Devil, one of God's creations.</p>

<p>These threats are used by all Christian missionaries in their attempt 
to make converts, and they are nearly impossible to remove from 
Christianity, or from Jesus' teachings.</p>

<p>This is alien to Paganism. Pagans are welcoming, and most are very 
willing to teach about their beliefs, but there is no threat behind it, 
no coercion to convert. Persons who come to Paganism come of their own 
free will, often as refugees from Christianity and its constant threats.
<p>
<p>The Pagan attitude is that <u>nothing</u> stands between you and the 
spiritual, except, perhaps, yourself. The Pagan attitude is that you 
will be judged on how well you played the cards life dealt you, 
regardless of your religion, if any, or your social status. You are 
totally responsible, not some entity you must mindlessly worship as 
payment for salvation.
<br class=cll></p>
<br>


<h2 id="earth">Earth Stewardship</h2>

<p><img src="img/Earthmoon01e.jpg" alt="Earth and Moon" class=mrg>
Both Judaism and Christianity hold that God gave man total dominion 
over the Earth, and the right to exploit it. This is totally 
incompatible with Paganism. The almost universal Pagan attitude is 
that we are embedded within the Earth, not ruling over it. Some have 
defined Paganism as a large collection of diverse Nature religions.
</p>

<p>There are entities below us and above us. It is our duty to do 
our best as stewards of the Earth, caring for it and the living beings 
on it. For many Pagans, everything, down to tiny grains of sand, has a 
consciousness of the type appropriate to its nature. Larger structures, 
such as mountains and seas, have a composite consciousness created from 
all the smaller consciousnesses they are composed of.</p>

<p>The same holds for human communities, they have a consciousness 
composed of the consciousnesses of all the individual humans within 
them.</p>

<p>The same holds for the human body, which is a community of billions 
of entities, both independent entities and those making up structures 
that are organs of our bodies. Even our individual cells (eukaryotes) 
are communities, formed from many once independent entities. They also 
contain critters that are still semi-independent, mitocondria, which 
have evolved to play extremely critical rolls in cell function, but 
maintain their own separate DNA.</p>

<p>Thus, to be a respectable member of the Pagan community, it is 
essential to chuck the domination theory of the Judeo-Christian 
tradition, and accept your place as embedded within a universe 
that you need to take care of.</p>
<br>

<h2>Slavery</h2>

<p><img src="img/slaves01c.jpg" alt="Slaves" class=mrg>
In many places in the gospel Jesus mentions slaves, but seems entirely 
accepting of slavery. He talks of the duties of a slave to the master, 
but nowhere preaches against the institution of slavery. Slaves are, of 
course, among the possessions to be sold so the proceeds can be given to 
the poor before following Jesus.</p>

<p>It is possible that in the various places where he describes "the 
least ones" exalted above the powerful, he may includes slaves, but 
this is not clarified anywhere.</p>

<p>Note that the so called Bible Belt in the United states is roughly 
the same area as the former Confederate States, all of which declared 
preservation of slavery to be their reason for secession. Clearly, 
freeing of the slaves was not due to Christianity, but to the 
increasing influence of humanism.</p>

<p>For sure, ancient Pagan peoples had slaves, but I know of no 
interest in restoring slavery among even the most hard core Pagan 
reconstructionists. In contrast, many Christians in the Bible Belt 
region are definitely in favor of restoring slavery. Alabama Senate 
candidate Roy Moore (2017), "The last time America was great was 
during slavery".
<br class=cll></p>
<br>

<h2>Animal Sacrifice</h2>

<p><img src="img/as_lamb04c.jpg" alt="Live Lamb" class=mrg>
It was required of Jews in those days to offer animal sacrifices as 
burnt offerings to God. These ranged from sparrows for the poor up to 
a bull for the very well to do. Jesus did not object to this, and gives 
some instruction as to your state of mind as you bring a gift to the 
altar of whole burnt-offerings [Mat V 23]. What Jesus objected to was 
merchants offering sacrificial animals for sale in the temple courtyard.
</p>

<p>Jewish law made it illegal to hold sacrifices, animal or other, 
except at the temple in Jerusalem, so when the temple was destroyed 
by the Romans, animal sacrifice and burnt offerings no longer were 
performed. There was a short lived revival during the Bar Kokhba 
revolt. Rabbinic Judaism requires gifts to charity rather than 
sacrifices.</p>

<p>Some Christian communities still do offer animal sacrifices, but 
they are done "Greek style" with the animal consumed in a feast or 
given to charity rather than being burned. Islam sacrifices many 
millions of animals a year, but again, they are eaten in feasts and 
given to charity.</p>

<p>It is true that in ancient times Pagans made offerings in pretty 
much the same way, though only the inedible parts were burned, the 
rest used in feasting or given to the poor. To the best of my knowledge 
no Neo-Pagans have come out in favor of animal sacrifice. Many Pagans 
today are vegetarians, or even vegans, as part of stewardship of the 
Earth.

<h2>The Kingdom of God <small>&amp;</small> The Second Coming</h2>

<p><img src="img/rapture01k.jpg" alt="Rapture" class=mrg>
Throughout the Gospels, Jesus declares the Kingdom of God is imminent. 
It did not come, making Jesus the first failed Rapture prophet. Paul 
preached to his followers that they should not get married and start 
families, but should concentrate on their religion, because the Kingdom 
of God was imminent, making him the second failed Rapture prophet.</p>

<p>Eventually, the faithful realized the delivery date for the Kingdom 
of God had been missed, by a wide margin, and Jesus did not appear on 
time either. So, they got busy starting families and building households 
so Christianity would not just fade away while they waited for these 
things to come to pass. Still waiting, despite no shortage of Rapture 
prophets and prophecy.</p>

<p>Pagans simply do not believe in the Rapture. We are part of the 
continuing Earth, and it is our responsibility to take care of it.
Many Pagans do believe in a life after death, but nothing like our 
physical life here. It doesn't involve being handed a harp and halo, 
having wings attached, and spending all of eternity singing praises 
to God - or toasting eternally in the "Hell of Fire" either.
<br class=cll></p>
<br>

<hr class=hr2s>
<br>

<h2 class=lrg>How can This Be Done?</h2>

<p><img src="img/Jesusa02k.jpg" alt="Jesus Altar" class=mrg>
How can an aspiring Christo-Pagan reconcile all these factors explained 
above? It seems far fetched, but with a good understanding of Paganism 
and Jesus, and a bit of determination, you may be able to work it out. 
One thing you have going for you is the breadth, depth, and tolerance 
of Paganism. Those who wished to create a "Big Tent of Paganism" have 
been rethinking - Paganism has just become too broad for any single 
tent to hold.</p>

<p>You won't be working within established rules for this, there are 
none. By far, the majority of Pagans are solo practitioners, many of 
them very eclectic in their views. There are polytheistic Pagans, and 
non-theistic Pagans and all other kinds, and it's considered very bad 
form for any variety to call another wrong. We do not believe there 
is one right path to truth, there are many paths.</p>

<p>Now you have work to do. The first step is to declare yourself free 
from the Church. You can join the rapidly expanding ranks of "Spiritual 
but Not Religious" as an entry point, or directly to the teachings of 
Jesus independent from the church. You should probably do this with a 
ritual, to help you break free, and stay free. We have suggestions for 
such a ritual on our page <a href="rituals/CPban1.html"><b>Banishing 
the Church</b></a>.</p>

<p>The next step is to declare yourself as living within the world 
(actually universe) as a <a href="CrPagan01.html#earth"><b>Steward of the Earth</b>
</a>, and truly believing that is so. This is a critical step into 
Paganism, as also is fully recognizing <a href="CrPagan01.html#gender"><b>Gender 
Balance</b></a> in deity. A formal ceremony may help. The Banishing 
ritual contains suggestions for this, or you can compose some other 
event.</p>

<p>Now, you need to set up your altar and start forming <u>your</u> 
concept of Jesus. Your concept may not fully follow the gospels, or any 
other source - Paganism is <i>intensely</i> personal. It should, 
though, be strongly based on what is known of the character of Jesus, 
not just pie in the sky, because it is Jesus you want to talk to.</p> 

<p>The altar serves as a portal for communication with the deity, in 
your case, Jesus. It can be extremely simple or quite elaborate, that's 
up to you - but its central feature <u>must</u> represent a connection 
to the deity <u>that is meaningful to you</u>. The example alter in the 
photo above includes the basic Pagan elements: Earth (the ceramic disk), 
Air (the incense), Fire (the candles), and Water (the bowl of flowers).
For more on the elements see <a href="Pagan01.html#fire"><b>The 
Elemental Realms</b></a>.</p>

<p>You can start forming <u>your</u> concept of Jesus with our section 
<a href="CrPagan01.html#teach"><b>What did Jesus Actually Teach?</b></a> as an 
entry point, and go on to <a href="CrPagan01.html#gosp"><b>The Gospels</b></a>. The 
Gospels are all we have to go by, but they are written by men for 
their own purposes. They are not the infallible words of Jesus himself. 
You have a little wiggle room here - and you are going to have to make  
adjustments. The world we live in is a lot different from the world 
Jesus lived in. Do hold to the teachings as closely as you can, 
realizing they were not designed to be comfortable.</p>

<p>Caution: do not accept anything from the teachings of Paul. His 
teachings are generally quite opposite those of Jesus. He is the 
heretic responsible for the malfeasance of the churches and Christians 
in general. For details see our page 
<a href="Paul01.html"><b>Jesus Betrayed</b></a>. Fortunately, the Gospels 
are free of the teachings of Paul, but the Epistles of Paul are loaded 
with it, constituting about a third of the entire New Testament.</p>

<p>With these things accomplished, or at least well within work, you 
are ready to establish a daily ritual. Ritual and the altar are what 
separates Paganism from "Spiritual but not Religious". The daily ritual 
can be no more than a few meaningful words, or more complex. It is good 
to have a series of rituals from very simple to elaborate, but you should 
start simple and work up.</p>

<p>A simple ritual should be performed at the altar every day, with 
more elaborate rituals for important commemorations. Again, the most 
important thing as that these rituals <u>are meaningful to you</u> 
- you do not have to follow established patterns, unless you want to.
</p>

<p>The altar establishes a portal for communication with the deity. 
The ritual establishes a mood to enhance your communication with the 
deity, and to focus your day and your purpose. Meditation at the altar 
is also a very powerful tool and highly recommended. Feel free to 
perform ceremonies at the altar. You can also feel free to involve 
others in this practice if it does not distract you from your purpose.
</p>

<p>Incidentally, <a href="http://SacredSource.com">Sacred Source</a> 
has a very good devotional statuette of Jesus in their Gnostic section, 
if you desire such, and also the statuette of Sofia pictured in the 
Gender section. </p>

<h2 class=lrg>Appendix</h2>
<p></p>

<h2 id="gosp">The Gospels</h2>

<p><img src="img/chirho01c.jpg" alt="Book of Kells Page" class=mrg>
The main references we have to Jesus' life are the four canonical 
gospels, consisting of the three synoptic gospels (Mark, Luke, Matthew), 
and the gospel of John. There were many other gospels, but most exist 
only as short references or tattered fragments. The most important are 
probably the Gospel of the Hebrews, probably in several version and 
written in Aramaic or Hebrew. These no longer exist, the gospels we 
have were written in Greek. Discovered in Egypt in 1886 is a large 
fragment of the gospel of Peter, describe by Origen and others as in 
use by the Hebrews. When it was composed is still a matter of 
contention.</p>

<p>In preparing this article, I used Kenneth S. Wuest's 1961 translation 
from the original Koin Greek, which is largely derived from the 
Nestle-Aland <i>Novum Testamentum Graece</i> - probably NA24. The current 
version is NA28 (2013). This source includes a lot of content unavailable 
in 1611 when the King James version was published, and is free of the 
King James instruction to select and word the translation to match the 
doctrines of the Church of England. It also includes many important 
variants for comparison by scholars.<p>

<p>The Wuest translation preserves the order of Greek words to the 
extent possible, and uses as many English words as are necessary to 
convey the full meaning of the Greek words, which may not translate 
well to a single English word. The arrangement and numbering system 
are designed to maximize readability and comprehension, but things 
can still be looked up by chapter and verse if you need to. I 
definitely recommend this New Testament.</p>

<p>The actual authors of the Gospels are unknown, but quite unlikely 
to be the apostles who's names are attached to them. For instance, 
the apostle John was an uneducated fisherman, but the Gospel of John 
is written in quite erudite Greek. On the other hand, early Christianity 
has more Johns than a house of ill repute, so there's been a lot of 
unresolved historical confusion.</p>

<p>In earlier times, Matthew was considered the first gospel written,
and the most important. Most modern scholars hold the order to be 
Mark first, Luke and Matthew about the same time, and John last. A 
common opinion was that they must all have been pretty much finalized 
by CE 70, as there is no mention of the destruction of the Jerusalem 
temple, despite Jesus' prophecy in the gospels. This is unlikely - 
mention of the destruction was an extremely sensitive issue at the time, 
and may have been deliberately avoided to distance Jesus from the event. 
Also, the rather low key prophecy may have been slipped into the gospels 
after the destruction.</p>

<p>Reading the Gospels is rather tedious, because so much of it just 
accounts for Jesus going from town to town miraculously curing people. 
Since, at the time, so many human conditions were blamed on demons, 
around half of Jesus' cures are performed by chasing out demons. The 
texts seem to imply that people could see the exiting demons, which 
makes weasel wording around this difficult. These can all be discounted 
as myths, and similarly for the other miraculous cures. The crowds around 
Jesus were probably far smaller than stated in the gospels. On the other 
hand, that Jesus did a lot of teaching during his travels is not so 
easy to discount.

<h2>Gospel of Mark</h2>

<p><img src="img/gosmrk01c.jpg" alt="Gospel Page of Mark" class=mrg>
This gospel was a major source document for the gospels of Luke and 
Matthew. It starts with Jesus' baptism by John the Baptizer, and ends 
with the empty tomb. It includes nothing of Jesus' early life nor any 
appearance after the tomb is found empty. Due to this, other endings 
have been written for it by other people, but are not official. It is 
thought Mark was composed  between CE 66 and 70, by reference to 
several earlier documents which are unknown today.
</p>

<p>There may also be a "Secret Mark". Though the evidence has been 
improved, it is still highly controversial. Only two quotations alleged 
to be from it exist, but both enhance understanding of deficient passages 
in the known Mark. Unless more is found, its existence will remain 
uncertain, and it will be unknown if it was an enhanced version of the 
known Mark, or if it was an original from which the known Mark was 
redacted.
<br class=cll><p>
<br>

<h2>Q Source</h2>

<p>This document has not been found, in whole or even fragments, but 
is presumed by most biblical scholars to have been a collection of 
sayings and teachings. A large hunk of both Luke and Matthew contain 
essentially the same material, often in the same order, and even in 
the same words. This material is presumed to have come from Q. </p>
<br>

<h2>Gospel of Matthew</h2>

<p><img src="img/gosmat01c.jpg" alt="Gospel Page of Matthew" class=mrg>
Matthew is considered the second of the canonical gospels to be 
written, but almost simultaneous with Luke. Neither refers to the 
other. Most researchers date it between 80 and 90 CE, but some 70 to 
110 CE. It was not written by the apostle Matthew, but probably by 
a converted Jew quite familiar with scriptures. He wrote in a well 
polished "synagogue Greek".</p>

<p>Matthew contains most of what is in Mark, some materials of unknown 
origin unique to Matthew (the M Source), and a good chunk from the 
hypothetical Q source. Like Luke, but unlike Mark, Matthew includes 
the nativity and other events in the life of Jesus up to baptism by 
John, where Mark begins. It also includes events subsequent to finding 
the empty tomb. It is quite a bit longer than Mark and somewhat shorter 
than Luke.</p>

<p>Matthew is thought to have been written in Israel or Syria for a 
Jewish audience, presenting Jesus as much as possible filling the 
expectations for the prophecy of the Messiah. He also emphasizes 
Jesus' descent from David for the same purpose.
<br class=cll></p>
<br>

<h2>Gospel of Luke &nbsp; &amp; &nbsp; Acts of the Apostles</h2>

<p><img src="img/gosluk01k.jpg" alt="Gospel Page of Luke" class=mrg>
Luke is considered the third of the canonical gospels to be written, 
but almost simultaneous with Matthew. The two do not refer to each 
other. Some date Luke and Acts between 80 and 90 CE, but others 90 to 
110 CE. It was not written by the Luke who accompanied Paul. The author 
apparently did not have access to the letters of Paul and his theology 
varies significantly from that of Paul. </p>

<p>Luke addressed his Gospel and Acts to Theophilus, but that person 
cannot be known. Theophilus was a common name, meaning "beloved of God", 
but also a title of the same meaning, and the works may have been 
addressed to a group of people using that honorific. This is all 
speculation, so the address cannot be used to date the Gospel.</p>

<p>Luke's two books are thought by scholars to be targeted to the 
Sadducees, the Jewish upper crust and keepers of the temple. The 
Sadducees believed only in the written law of the Torah, and did 
not believe in resurrection. They disappeared some years after  
destruction of the temple in 70 CE.<p>

<p>Luke contains most of what is in Mark, some materials of unknown 
origin unique to Luke (the L Source), and a good chunk from the 
hypothetical Q source. Unlike Mark, Luke includes the nativity and other 
events in the life of Jesus up to baptism by John, where Mark begins. 
It also includes events subsequent to finding the empty tomb. It is 
quite a bit longer than Mark and somewhat longer than Matthew.</p>

<p>No two ancient versions of Luke, whole or fragmented, are in complete 
agreement. Luke was still being actively revised well into the second 
century, with two major versions, the Western and the Alexandrian. The 
Western is considered the most deliberately revised in its meaning.</p>

<h3>Acts of the Apostles</h3> was written by the author of the Gospel 
of Luke, probably between 80 and 90 CE. It is the story of the Christian 
Church from the ascension of Jesus until Paul's imprisonment in Rome. 
It is thought Paul was executed in Rome a little before 68 CE. It is 
clear the writer did not know Paul personally, nor did he have access 
to Paul's letters, because when discussing Paul, in a couple of places 
he has Paul urging charity and good works. Paul preached that only 
faith is important, and that charity and good works were of no value 
towards salvation.
<p></p>
<br>

<h2>Gospel of John</h2>

<p><img src="img/gosjon01c.jpg" alt="Earliest Fragment of New Testament" class=mrg>
John is considered the last of the canonical gospels to be written. 
Most researchers hold it to be written between 90 and 110 CE. Until near 
the end of the 20th century, John was thought completely independent 
from the three synoptic gospels, but modern scholarship holds the 
writer was familiar with Mark and Luke, but felt comfortable with 
re-writing almost completely. As with the other gospels, the identity 
of that person is unknown.</p>

<p>The writer of John attributed the ultimate source to the "Disciple 
whom Jesus Loved", but does not claim that person was the writer. 
This person has not been identified and the term "Disciple whom Jesus 
Loved" appears in no other document. It could even be a code for a 
small committee, or simply refer to all of Jesus faithful.</p>

<p>Interestingly, John has Jesus in a Samaritan town preaching to 
and healing Samaritans, where the other Gospels have him avoiding 
Samaritans and ordering his disciples to avoid Samaritans. There are 
other incidents not in the other gospels, including turning water into 
wine, raising Lazarus, the adulterous woman, etc.</p>

<p>While in the other gospels, Jesus hides that he is the Son of God, 
in John he preaches it openly and incessantly</p>

<p>John is much more difficult to read than Matthew or Luke. It is 
more disjointed, and it is often difficult to know who is being spoken 
to. Many times you must think of corresponding events in the other 
gospels for context.

<br class=cll></p>
<br>

<h2>Revelations</h2>

<p><img src="img/revel01c.jpg" alt="Illustration of Revelations" class=mrg>
The Revelations of John was definitely not written by the same person 
as the Gospel of John. So far, no one has come up with an interpretation 
that satisfies anyone else, so I'm just attributing it to the disjointed 
ravings of a deranged mind and ignoring it.
<br class=cll></p>

<h2 id="teach">What did Jesus Actually Teach?</h2>

<p><img src="img/Jesus03k.jpg" alt="Jesus and the Rich Young Man" class=mrg>
All these things are gathered from the gospels, the canonic gospels 
and some apocrypha. There is no hard evidence they are what Jesus 
actually said - but it's the best evidence we have.</p>

<p>The teachings listed here are gathered from the gospels, mostly from 
a new translation from the Greek (see <a href="CrPagan01.html#gosp"><b>The 
Gospels</b></a> for details). The list here is nowhere near complete - 
you have to read the gospels for completion and context.  I use mostly 
Matthew here, because the teachings are particularly numerous and clear 
in that Gospel.
<br class=cll></p>

<ul>
<li><b>John 3:16:</b> &nbsp; King James: "Whosoever believeth in him, may 
  not perish, but may have life everlasting". This is described as 
  "The gospels in a nutshell".</li>

<li><b>Judgement</b> &nbsp; Jesus claims to be the sole judge of your 
  worthiness. (John V 22, etc.) The Father does not judge anyone but 
  has given judgement wholly to the Son. All should be honoring the  
  Son just as they honor the Father. Jesus' main criterion is if you 
  have believed in him, and followed his teachings, including having 
  sold all your possessions and given the proceeds to the poor. He is 
  flexible on this, as good works are his main criterion, even where 
  belief is not evident.</li>

<li><b>Love thy Neighbor:</b> &nbsp; Jesus states that you must love 
  your brother as you love yourself - and includes your enemies as 
  "your brother", with the commandment to love them as well
  (Mat 38-48 and others). </li>

<li><b>Forgiveness:</b> &nbsp; Jesus requires forgiveness of all 
  offences against you, and places no limit on how many times you 
  should forgive someone for those offences. He states that it 
  is not up to 7 times, but 70 times 7 (Mat XVIII 21-27).</li>

<li><b>Praying, etc.:</b> &nbsp; Jesus told that praying, fasting, 
  and other devotions should be done in privacy, even secrecy, seen 
  only by God. This in contrast to those "Actors on the stage of life" 
  who made a great public display of praying, fasting, and being 
  learned in the scriptures, in the synagogues and on the street 
  (Mat VI, VII, etc.).</li>

<li><b>Bread:</b> &nbsp; He states that man does not live on bread 
  alone, but also by every word from God's mouth. Bread, however, 
  has a strong place in all the Gospels.</li>

<li><b>Wealth:</b> &nbsp; In the gospels Jesus says it is as difficult 
  for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven as for a camel to pass 
  through the eye of a needle. In the Greek, it is clear this means the 
  eye of a sewing needle, not the low narrow night time port called 
  "eye of the needle" in a city wall, through which a camel could 
  pass, on its knees.</li>

<li><b>Marriage:</b> &nbsp; Jesus taught that a married couple should 
  be "of one flesh". He taught that any re-marriage after divorce was 
  adultery, and to be punished as such. In the Kingdom of God, people 
  do not marry nor give in marriage. All marriages from the temporal 
  world are void in the Kingdom of God.</li>

<li><b>Homosexuality:</b> &nbsp; Jesus is totally silent on this and 
  other sexual issues. All of what the churches preach on these issues 
  is from one paragraph of the heretic apostle Paul.</li>

<li><b>Abortion:</b> &nbsp; Jesus is totally silent on this issue.</li>

<li><b>Sermon on the Mount</b> [new from the Greek - Mat V 1-12]
  <ul>
  <li>Blessed are the destitute and helpless in the realm 
    of the spirit, because theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</li>
  <li>Blessed are those who are mourning, because they 
    shall be encouraged and strengthened by consolation.</li>
  <li>Blessed are those who are meek, because they 
    shall inherit the earth.</li>
  <li>Blessed are those hungering and thirsting for righteousness, 
    because they shall be filled so as to be completely satisfied.</li>
  <li>Blessed are those that are merciful, because they 
    shall be the objects of mercy</li>
  <li>Blessed are those that are pure of heart, because they shall 
    see God.</li>
  <li>Blessed are those who make peace, for they shall be called sons 
    of God.</li>
  <li>Blessed are those who have been persecuted on account of 
    righteousness, because theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</li>
  <li>Blessed are you whenever they shall revile you and persecute you 
    and say pernicious thing against you, telling deliberate falsehoods 
    on account of me.</li>
  <li>Rejoice and exult exceedingly, because your reward is great in 
    heaven - for this is how they persecuted the prophets who came 
    before you.</li>
  </ul>

<li><b>The Law (Mat V 13-48, VI 1-8):</b> &nbsp; Sermon on the mount 
  continued.  Jesus states with emphasis that you should not suppose he 
  came to destroy the law or the prophets. He came not to destroy but to 
  fulfill prophecy and the law. He than goes through commandments and 
  laws and interprets them far beyond the literal. If you even think 
  about it, or anything close to it, you are subject to "the judgement" 
  and possibly the "Hell of Fire". You'll have to read Matthew yourself, 
  there's way too much detail for me to list here.</li>

<li><b>The Lord's Prayer (Mat VI 9-13):</b> &nbsp; [new from the Greek] 
  "Therefore, as for you, in this manner be praying"
  <br>Our Father who is in heaven, let your Name be venerated, let your 
  kingdom come, let your will be done, as in heaven, so on earth. Our 
  bread, that for the coming day, give us today. And forgive us the moral 
  obligations we owe, even as also, as for us, we have forgiven those 
  morally obligated to us. And do not lead us into the place of testing,
  where a solicitation to do evil would tempt us to sin, but deliver us 
  from the Pernicious One.</li>

<li><b>Pharisees and Sadusees:</b> &nbsp; (Mat XXIII 1-39 and many 
  other places) Jesus raved mostly against the Pharisees, because they 
  were common and based in the synagogues. The Sadusees were an upper 
  class focused on the temple, and not so commonly seen, though Jesus 
  held them in no greater regard. He called both "Those learned in the 
  scriptures" and "Actors on the stage of life playing the roll of what 
  they are not." It can be presumed this is what Jesus' opinion of "Those 
  learned in the scriptures" of the Christian churches would be, but 
  those did not exist yet. He stated they were snakes, progeny of vipers, 
  and that they could not possibly escape the judgement and Hell. The 
  Sadusees disappeared soon after destruction of the temple, while 
  current synagogue Judaism was founded largely by the Pharisees.</li>

<li><b>Dissention:</b> &nbsp; Jesus gets very threatening in Mat X 32, 
  saying he came to sow dissention and set family members against each 
  other in his name.</li>

<li><b>Food &amp; Shelter:</b> &nbsp; Jesus tells his faithful not to 
  pay any attention to their bodies, or their need for food, shelter, 
  or clothing. God will take care of that for you, just as he takes care 
  of "the birds of the heavens" (Mat VI 23). This doesn't work too well 
  here in Los Angeles, and would be much less practical in the Frozen 
  North, a regions Jesus was entirely unfamiliar with.</li>
  
<li><b>Children:</b> &nbsp; Jesus said, "Permit the children to come 
  to me, for of such as these is the kingdom of heaven".</li> 
  
<li><b>Jews Only:</b> &nbsp; Jesus considered his ministry to be for 
  Jews, and for Jews only (Mat XV 21-28). A Canaanite woman came to him 
  knelt before him, touched her head to the ground and asked him to 
  cast out demons from her daughter. At first he ignored her, then 
  admonished her that his work was only for the children of Israel. 
  She persisted, and Jesus, noting her intense faith in him, finally 
  made an exception and cast the demons out. If Jesus still holds to 
  this, there are precious few in the world today that would qualify 
  for his salvation. There is evidence this qualification is somewhat 
  relaxed in the chapters regarding his crucifixion and beyond.</li>


<li><b>Kingdom of God:</b> &nbsp; Given Jesus severe requirements 
  for being saved: Jewish, having total faith in him, disposing of all 
  properties, holding strictly to his expansion of the laws 
  (Mat V 13-48, VI 1-8), and following him, perhaps the Kingdom of God 
  did come, and Jesus did re-appear, but so few qualified for the 
  Rapture it was a very private affair, unnoticed by the rest of the 
  world. If so, don't be expecting the Rapture.</li>   

<li><b>Faith:</b> &nbsp; Above all, Jesus stresses faith in himself 
  and God. Faith is being absolutely certain of something without 
  evidence or proof. Faith blinds the mind, making it impossible to 
  rationally evaluate anything impinging on that faith. Psychologists 
  have studied this in depth. In contrast, Paganism is not faith, but 
  applying to your life what works for you, your relationship with 
  the spiritual, with others, and with the world - and not fearing to 
  adjust it as needed. It is not at all unusual for a theist Pagan to 
  switch from one "supreme" God/dess to another in different phases 
  of their life. Some call this "serial monotheism", but if each is 
  in turn called "supreme", it is properly called kathenotheism, or, 
  if each one is not held as "supreme" it is "henotheism".</li>

</ul>
