<h1>Subtle Bodies</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p><span class=bg>
The concept that humans (and other entities) exist in more than what we 
perceive as the physical realm is important within every non-Christian 
religion in the world, and in some non-religious philosophies as well. It 
was important in early Christianity, but was strongly, often viciously, 
suppressed by the churches - as it implies spiritual experience uncontrolled 
by church authority.</span></p>

<p><span class=bg>Concepts of this multi-level existence vary in detail 
from one religion or philosophy to another, particularly in how many layers 
and how many energy centers within the body, but there is considerable 
agreement as to basic concepts.</span></p>

<p><span class=bg>Now in the 21st Century, Physics has progressed to the point many 
scientists accept the probability there is much outside our concept of 
physical reality. The Subtle Body is being re-appraised in the light of 
Psychology, Quantum Physics, and Mathematics.

<b>A Pagan Reality</b></a> page. Its purpose is to explain concepts that are

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>It has been only since the late 20th century that <i>Esotericism</i>, 
the study of the entire broad field of religious and philosophical thought 
and practice worldwide, has become accepted as legitimate study in Western 
academia. Previously, there had only been specialties. This is now an 
expanding field of study.</p>

<p>Students of Esotericism are divided into two camps. In anthropology, 
the two camps are: studying a culture from without, and studying it from 
full immersion within.  Esotericism also includes those who study it from 
without, and those who study it through full immersion in thought and 
practice. Both are right, neither is wrong, and they have much to offer 
each other.</p>

<p>Traditional Esotericism divided reality into two realms, the lower 
<i>Microcosm</i> (where we live) and the higher <i>Macrocosm</i> (where the 
Gods and other spiritual beings live). The Hermetic statement, "As above, so 
below, but in different form", references this relationship. Western Esoteric 
study has now introduced a new concept: the <i>Mesocosm</i>, the middle realm 
where the human Microcosm interfaces with the Macrocosm. It is to this middle 
realm that study of Subtle Bodies belongs.</p>


<h2>Paganism <small>in the </small> Mesocosm</h2> 

<p>Some Pagans reject working with the Subtle Bodies, considering it an 
invasion of the territory of the Gods. They prefer to maintain a strictly 
devotional practice. Others, both Theistic and Non-Theistic, are very open 
to this experience, and adopt concepts and practices from Hinduism, Yoga, 
Buddhism, Sikhism (Mystic Islam), Taoism, Western Hermeticism, and African 
folk religion, often in a "mix and match" sort of way (eclecticism).</p>

<p>There are some signs this very scattered field will eventually coalesce 
into a broad Western esoteric format. It is likely, though, like Paganism 
itself, to remain wonderfully diverse.</p>

<p>The best known formats in the West stem from Hinduism and Buddhism, 
including Yogic and Tantric practices from both. In these practices, the 
objective of reaching into the esoteric realms and the Subtle Bodies is to 
achieve liberation from the realm of the physical body. This is through 
various meditative disciplines, and understanding the relationship amongst 
the bodily energy centers (chakras) and the Subtle Bodies.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Pagans are generally very Earth centered, so the Taoist 
approach is relevant. It emphasizes <u>extending</u> consciousness into the 
subtle realms, while still firmly rooted in the Earthly realm.</p>

<h2 class=lrg>A Quick Once-Over</h2>
<p></p>
<p>All of the religions and philosophies that deal with Subtle Bodies are 
very complex, and take considerable study to understand. All we can do here 
is give a very brief description of their approach, necessarily incomplete 
and imperfect. For study of any of them that may interest you, there are 
many books written by people who have been immersed in them and understand 
them well.</p>

<p>All of the religions and philosophies mentioned here are far and away 
broader than our discussion here, but here we only offer a brief comparison 
of concepts of the Subtle Body(s). For the serious student, there is enough 
literature to fill a library on each of them.</p> 

<h2>Hinduism</h2> 
<br><img src="img/pg_om01c.jpg" alt="Om Symbol" class=mrg>
There is no "Hinduism". That's a name of convenience applied by the British 
during the Raj, to lump together many loosely related schools and practices. 
The oldest texts are the Vedas, transmitted orally from around 1700 BCE, but 
many schools of "Hinduism" do not accept the Vedas.

<p>The concepts and practices of any of these schools are complex and would 
require a book apiece to give decent coverage, and there are such books. 
Here we will just name a few concepts you will hear talked about. Further 
investigation is up to you.</p>

<p>The attitude of Hinduism regarding the Subtle Body is most clearly 
delineated in Tantric Yoga. The physical body contains a number of energy 
centers, called <i>Chakras</i>. They are arranged along the spine from the 
base to the final one at the top of the head. These are connected by 
<i>Nadis</i>, energy paths. There may also be subsidiary Chakras in other 
parts of the body.</p>

<p>The Chakras are named for organs and body parts, but are not identical 
with them. Each Chakra is matched to a layer of the Subtle Body, called  a 
<i>Kosa</i>. The highest Chakra is matched to the outermost and least dense 
Kosa.</p>

<p>The main objective of Hinduism is to be liberated from the physical body, 
passing up through the Chakras and through layers of the Subtle Body, finally 
becoming one with Divinity, liberated, and escaping the cycle of rebirth. 
This is done through various practices of study, ethics, and meditation.</p> 

<p>Yogic body positions and breathing exercises are carefully tuned to the 
various Chakras, to aid in "opening" them through meditation and passing 
through the related Kosas.</p>

<p>The number of major Chakras varies with school, from 4 to 8, with up to 
88,000 minor Chakras. The system that has been widely accepted in the West 
includes 7 major Chakras, and perhaps a few minor ones, especially in the 
hands.
<br class=cll></p>
<p></p>

<h2>Buddhism</h2>
<br><img src="img/pg_dharma02c.jpg" alt="Wheel of Dharma" class=mrg>
Buddhism is largely derived from non-Vedic Hinduism. There are three 
main schools of Buddhism: Theravada ("Pali Canon": Sri Lanka and mainland 
Southeast Asia, except Vietnam), Mahayana ("Chinese Buddhism" and Zen: East 
Asia, Vietnam, Singapore), and Vajrayana ("Tibetan Buddhism"), thought by 
some to be a variety of Mahayana.

<p>As with various schools of Hinduism, the main goal of spiritual advancement 
in all Buddhist schools is to transcend the body and liberate oneself from the 
circle of rebirth. This is mainly by meditative disciplines and passage 
through the Chakras as one builds the Subtle Body that will transcend the 
physical, and achieves Nirvana, annihilation of the self and union with 
Divinity. Originally, Buddhism recognized four Chakras, but in later times 
expanded to five.
<br class=cll></p>
<p></p>

<h2>Sufism</h2>
<br><img src="img/pg_sufi02c.jpg" alt="Sufi Winged Heart" class=mrg>
This is the mystic form of Islam, though many mainstream Muslims consider 
it to be "outside" of Islam. It is best known in the West for orders that 
include the Whirling Dervishes. Their dance is a form of meditation in 
motion, and to music. Traditionally it was restricted to men, but today, 
in some regions, women are also allowed to dance, and even mixed groups. 
Other Sufi orders do not use this form of meditation.
<p>The Sufis recognize three components of the self: the <i>nafs</i> or 
lower "ego self", <i>qalb</i> or "spiritual heart", and the <i>ruh</i> the 
"higher self" which is without dimension and eternal, roughly equivalent to 
eternal soul. There is also a subtle body, the <i>nasma</i>, equivalent to 
an "astral body", which may hang around for some time after death of the 
physical body and departure of the eternal <i>ruh</i>.</p>
<p>Sufis recognize six subtle centers, <i>latifas</i>, concepts similar to 
the Chakras of India, which the seeker purifies and passes through in order 
from lowest to highest on the path to oneness with Allah. The methods, as 
with other paths, are study and meditation.
<br class=cll></p>
<p></p>

<h2>Taoism</h2>
<br><img src="img/pg_tao01c.jpg" alt="Tao Symbol" class=mrg>
Taoism is a syncretic religion including influences from Confucianism, 
Buddhism, Hinduism, and Animism. It differs from Buddhism and Hinduism 
in that, as one progresses into the higher realms, one keeps one's feet 
firmly on the ground. Progress is made by extending the consciousness 
rather than abandoning the body. The Earth is not rejected as suffering, 
but as a place to enjoy, much as in current Paganism and in ancient 
Egypt.

<p>The mystical aspect of Taoism is tied directly in with Qigong, the 
medicinal and healing practice. It recognizes three Zones and three 
Energy Centers (<i>Dantiens</i>) in the human body, and a number of paths 
and minor centers.</p>
<p>The <b>Heaven-linking zone</b> is from about the nose to the top of the 
head, where there is a port that can open to <i>Baihui</i> (Heaven, the 
formless transcendent realm). This zone hosts the Upper Dantien.
<br>The <b>Earth-linking zone</b> is from the navel on down, hosting the Lower 
Dantien.
<br>The <b>Movable zone</b> is between the other two zones, and can move 
from the solar plexus to the heart. This zone includes the Middle Dantien 
and is particularly coupled to the hands. The hands concentrate, amplify, and 
direct energies, both outward and inward.</p>
<p>Taoist Meditation practice includes "Concentration", "Insight", and 
"Ecstatic Excursions". The goal is to extend through the Zones and Dantiens and 
achieve the "Body of Enlightenment", the Subtle Body or Transcendent Body, and 
pass into the Baihui (Heaven), achieving immortality.
<br class=cll></p>
<p></p>

<h2>Neo-Platonism</h2>
<br><img src="img/pg_plotinus01s.jpg" alt="Plotinus &amp; Students" class=mrg>
Plato (about 423-348 BCE) taught at a time when abstractions that had no 
physical form or place were becoming important concepts. The Neo-Platonists 
(about 232-485 CE) continued his teachings with elaboration on his themes.  
They had considerable influence on Christian, Islamic, and Judaic thought 
through the Middle Ages, and continue to influence philosophers to this day.

<p>Neo-Platonism holds that there are three bodies, the Soul, the Subtle 
Body (which may be in several layers), and the physical body. Whether the 
Soul is eternal or just everlasting concerned the Neo-Platonists, but we 
will not speculate on that here. The physical body was seen to have a set of 
energy centers, similar in concept to the Chakras of Tantra, which formed a 
sort of ladder to attainment and union with "The One". The path of achievement 
in Neo-Platonism is more intellectual than in Tantra, through philosophical 
contemplation.
<br class=cll></p>
<p></p>

<h2>Alchemy</h2>
<br><img src="img/pg_alchemy04s.jpg" alt="Alchemical Symbolism" class=mrg>
Thought to have originated in ancient Egypt, Alchemy is a complex spiritual 
system that also applied chemical and metallurgic symbologies. Some alchemists 
were financed by nobles in hopes they would succeed in transmuting lead into 
gold, but the central pursuit of Alchemy was purification of the human body, 
mind, soul and spirit. There was also a strong devotion to healing.

<p>There is little doubt that Western Alchemy accepted concepts of the 
Subtle Bodies, though there are difficulties in interpretation due to obscure 
terminology and symbology. All in all, Alchemy's map of the internal 
human structure is strongly parallel to Tantric Yoga, with 7 metals and 7 
planets being similar concepts to the 7 Chakras. Other concepts are also 
notably parallel.</p>

<p>Psychoanalyst Carl Jung was intensely interested in Alchemy, especially 
in its symbology, which he felt was aligned with his own system of archetypes. 
Today, study and practice of the "Great Work" is carried on by the 
International Alchemy Guild and by other students of Alchemy.
<br class=cll></p>
<p></p>


<h2>Kabbalah</h2>
<br><img src="img/pg_kabal05s.jpg" alt="Sepharoth" class=mrg>
This is a mystical Jewish interpretation of the relationships and paths of 
the energy centers of the sacred "Tree of Life". It appeared in the 13th 
century but probably incorporates elements of Jewish mysticism from several 
hundred years before.

<p>During the Renaissance, Kabbalah was adopted into Western Hermeticism and 
integrated with elements from Tarot, Astrology, Alchemy, Neo-Platonism, 
Gnosticism, Tantra, and the Pagan pantheons. It has been, and continues to 
be used by many Western mystical orders and societies.</p>

<p>It is clear that the relationships between the energy centers and the 
paths between them roughly parallel the Chakras and Nadis of Yogic Hinduism. 
There is a "Lightning Bolt Path" from the bottom passing through every  
Sephirah to Kether (the Crown). Of course Subtle Bodies are associated with 
progress through the energies, and expand into the Divine when Kether is 
achieved.
<br class=cll></p>
<p></p>

<h2>Theosophy, etc.</h2>
<br><img src="img/pg_theos01s.jpg" alt="Theosophical Logo" class=mrg>
<p>Theosophy (God Wisdom) and Anthroposophy (Human Wisdom) are spiritual 
movements founded in the late 19th century and early 20th century that 
still have considerable influence today. Some of their systems have been 
incorporated in various "New Age" practices. They maintain the human has 
multiple states (body, soul, spirit) and various Subtle Bodies.</p>

<p>Theosophy was a spiritual movement founded in New York in 1875 by Helena 
Blavatsky, Henry Olcott, and William Quan Judge. It's main principles come 
from Blavatsky's writings, particularly <i>Isis Unveiled</i> and <i>The 
Secret Doctrine</i>. Much of her doctrine was based on Hindu and 
Buddhist practices, and uses Indian terms, but not accurately, causing some 
confusion. She claimed she learned her material in Tibet from a brotherhood 
of spiritual masters, known as Mahatmas. She claimed it was a modern 
transmission of the "once universal religion" from deep in the human 
past.</p>

<p>Alice Baily and her husband Foster Bailey were expelled from the 
Theosophical Society and founded their own Lucis Trust in 1922, but 
maintained a lot of the Theosophic structures. She maintained her writings 
were telepathically dictated by a Tibetan master later identified as Djwal 
Khul. Her most important work was <i>Esoteric Healing</i> which is the basis 
for much of the New Age Healing movement. She was the first to declare the 
"Age of Aquarius" and use the term "New Age".</p>

<p>Rudolf Steiner, an Austrian  philosopher, social reformer, architect, 
esotericist, and claimed clairvoyant, also started with Theosophy. He broke 
away in 1912, taking most of the German section of the Theosophical Society 
with him. He declared his movement under the name Anthroposophy, and 
replaced Blavatsky's terminology with Western terms, but kept much of the 
structure. Many Steiner founded schools still exist, as do his theories on 
biodynamic agriculture and anthroposophical medicine These have influenced 
the New Age movement. Steiner claimed, as an advanced clairvoyant, he could 
clearly see the shapes and colors of the Subtle Bodies and determine 
character and emotional state from them.
<br class=cll></p>
<p></p>

<h2>"New Age" Spirituality</h2>
<br><img src="img/pg_newage01s.jpg" alt="Astrological Circle" class=mrg>
<p>It must be noted that the term "New Age" is now a classification used by 
academics and journalists, and is rejected by most "New Age" participants. The 
name originally referred to the astrological precession of the equinox from 
the "Age of Pisces" to the "Age of Aquarius", which has happened, is happening, 
or about to happen, depending on calculations. This umbrella term continues 
to be used because no other term has arisen to define this extremely eclectic 
and extremely syncretic milieu, otherwise almost impossible to define at all.
</p>

<p><u>Update 2021 June</u> &nbsp; The validity of the Spiritual Wellness 
movement has come seriously into question, especially here in California, 
as many participants have "taken the Red Pill". That's code for having 
devoted themselves to the absurd conspiracy theories of Q Anon. Many in the 
movement who have retained their sanity have been saddened by having to cut 
off former friends to avoid the continuous spouting of absurdity. This was 
reported in detail in the Los Angeles Times, starting on page A1 June 25 
2021.</p>

<p>"Spiritual but not Religious" is the fastest growing religious category 
in the United States, mostly at cost to mainstream Protestantism, but the 
Evangelicals are starting to take hits as well. A fair number of people in 
this category align with the "New Age" category to one degree or another. 
Diverse groups and practices of this grouping draw from every one of the 
other structures on this page, in various mixes, and from structures not 
included here as well.</p>

<p>That divinity is all encompassing, including humans (the divine within), 
is a very common attitude, and that there are beings that are not of the 
physical realm, especially "guides", who assist in healing work. Many are 
into Energy Healing using the Subtle Bodies and Chakras, much of which 
practice is loosely related to the patterns of Tantric Yoga and the Western 
spiritual movements of the 19th and 20th centuries. Those also drew 
liberally from Eastern sources.
<br class=cll></p>
<p></p>

<h2 id="21st">21st Century</h2>
<br><img src="img/pg_quantum01s.jpg" alt="Quantum Hydrogen over Graphite" class=mrg>
For centuries, science has denied all concepts outside of observable physical 
reality. That denial has now been broken - by mathematics and physics. Quantum 
physics has shown convincingly that "quantum entanglement" ignores Einsteinian 
physics by operating instantaneously over great distances. Mathematics has 
postulated a great pool of potential energy underlying physical reality, but 
not part of it. Experimental quantum physics has confirmed its existence. 

<p>Many mathematicians and physicists are now accepting there are things 
outside of physical reality that are invisible to our eyes and our 
instruments, so their extent and characteristics are not measurable. Some  
can be shown to exist by very esoteric experiments detecting their influences 
upon the physical realm. The long discredited all prevasive "ether" is back, 
as the "Quantum Vacuum". It appears as emptyness to us, but physicists suspect 
it's not at all empty.</p>

<p>"Consciousness" and "Mind" have never been defined by science, and were 
deliberately excluded from consideration in defining the laws of physics. 
Too messy. They are now in play, as acting within the physical realm, but 
not being of the physical realm. Previously, "consciousness" was considered 
a byproduct of complexity. Now it seems more likely the complexity of 
living systems developed in response to the demands of consciousness, and 
consciousness acts from outside physics.</p>

<p>Given this new outlook, many mathematicians and physicists are now 
willing to give serious consideration to evidence of the Subtle Body and 
extra-physical abilities, including distant viewing and distant healing. 
Such consideration may even help extend physics into the extra-physical 
realm, which now seems necessary.</p>

<p>In practice, many people already accept and work with elements of the 
Subtle Body, particularly in healing work, and reportedly often work with 
beings resident in the subtle realm. I'm sure they would appreciate any 
additional information science may provide.</p>

<p>I will make no attempt here to explain all that is involved in 
investigating the concept of the Subtle Body in the 21st Century - it took 
Maureen Lockhert Ph.D, a person with far greater expertise than I on the 
subject, 163 large and complex pages in Chapters 15 through 18 of her book 
to describe it (see <a href="Subtle01.html#ack"><b>Acknowledgements</b></a>). I recommend 
this book highly, with one caveat. Her writing is clear and understandable, 
but the subject matter is very complex, so don't expect it to be light 
reading. It isn't.

<h3>Auras <small>&amp;</small>Kirlian Photography</h3>

<p><img src="img/pg_kirlian01c.jpg" alt="Kirlian Photo of an Aster" class=mrg>
Kirilan Photos are photographic contact prints made by application of high 
electrical voltages at high frequencies to an object resting on a photographic 
film. For almost 100 years, claims have been made that Kirilan Photography can 
reveal the human aura or subtle body. These claims have not yielded any 
practical use or repeatable relationship to health or emotions.</p>

<p>Kirlian photos show an aura, but one easily explained by proven physical 
phenomena, and can as easily be made of inanimate objects, not reputed to 
have auras. Further, they are theoretically invalid. Subtle bodies exist in 
non-physical realms, so can be detected only by a being that has presence in 
those realms, not by any apparatus confined to the physical realm.</p>

<p>Most Pagans have a high respect for science and it's ability to describe 
the physical realm - discarding paranormal explanations when a perfectly good 
physical explanation has been demonstrated. Artists, however, have made good 
use of Kirilian Photography to produce attractive prints, such as that of a 
flowering Aster branch shown to the left.

I am a largely Non-Theist Pagan, but Lady Freya has recently entered the 
household. She seems to be branching out from her Germanic roots - 
note her Yoga style pose and Japanese companion (Shinto I presume). 
It's all OK, since Vedic Hinduism originated from the same Proto 
Indo-European root as Germanic Paganism.</p>
