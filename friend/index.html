 - A broad discussion board hosting many topics. While most participants 
have a technical background the action is now mostly in non-technical 
threads (news, politics, economics, health &amp; food, general 
discussion). This is now a pretty much closed discussion board, not 
recruiting new members.

<a href="http://www.jenniewebbsite.com/"><h3>Jennie Webb</h3></a>
<p>
Playwright, lecturer, columnist, theater critic and pen for hire, Jenny wields 
a wide range of writing skills. She is well known among the Los Angeles 
literati - and Los Angeles <u>is</u> "The Creative Capital of the World", 
after all (but New York claims their creatives are "cooler" because 
they're all unemployed). Jennie is married to Sleepy James, who also 
appears on this list.

<h3>Katrelia &nbsp; - &amp; - &nbsp; Mary's Market</h3>
<p>Writer and lecturer on mythopoeic subjects, Katrelya Angus is particularly 
expert in the works of Tolkein and C. S. Lewis. She also does belly dancing, 
as demonstrated in the photos from Christmas at Mary's Store in Sierra 
Madre. She is also a possum enthusiast. <b>Mary's Store and Canyon Cafe</b> 
has been operating in the canyons above Sierra Madre since the 1920s.

<a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/friend/malmcc.html"><h3>Mallory &amp; Mc Call</h3></a>
<p>
Jan and Mallory had a long performing career, specializing in costumed 
entertainment in several historical formats and are particularly noted 
for their pirate songs. Unfortunately, they're pretty much retired now 
due to matters of health. Check out the photos from 
<a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/friend/malmcc.html"><b><i>La Tierra de La Culebra</i></b></a>. 
They also produced wonderful bead and knot based neckwear for sale at 
<b>Pirate Primitive</b>, but the Web site is now closed.

<a href="http://www.sleepyjames.com/"><h3>Sleepy James</h3></a>
<p>
Singer and songwriter, Sleepy has toiled in the music vineyard for more than 
40 years...and has no intention to stop now. His latest CD, 
"The American Prisoner," featuring 15 original tunes, is available at CD 
Baby and iTunes. He's married to literary diva Jennie Webb (see above).

 &nbsp; - AND - &nbsp; 
<a href="http://us.paganfederation.org/index.php"><h3>PFI United States</h3></a>
<p>
The Pagan Federation seeks to support all Pagans to ensure they have the 
same rights as the followers of other beliefs and religions. It aims to 
promote a positive profile for Pagans and Paganism and to provide 
information on Pagan beliefs to the media, official bodies and the 
greater community.

<a href="https://loopbraider.com/"><h3>Loop Braiding</h3></a>
<p>
Loop braiding is a way to make useful and decorative cords and bands, 
using only your hands and some yarn or string. It has a long history, 
worldwide, going back thousands of years. Some patterns have been 
preserved in medieval and later manuscripts from England and Japan.

<a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/friend/rcohen.html"><h3>Robin Cohen</h3></a>
<p>
A former dancer, Robin now does sculpture in stone, semi-abstract 
paintings, and custom paintings of sports figures, on canvas, T shirts, 
soccer balls, and other appropriate objects (and she might do politicians 
if the pay was good).
