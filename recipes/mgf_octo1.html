This very nice salad from the east coast of Tunisia. It will be enjoyed 
even by people who "don't like salads". This recipe makes enough salad 
for 4 to 6 servings, depending.

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 hrs - 35 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>OCTOPUS</b> in large pieces (if large) so it fits the pan 
    well. Put it in a large saucepan with the <b>Vinegar</b> and enough 
    <b>Water</b> to cover well. Bring to a boil and simmer until 
    sufficiently tender (it'll still be a little chewy), but the skin 
    and sucker disks stay on. This is a bit tricky, so see 
    <a href="mgf_octo1.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a>. Refresh under cold water when done.
    </li>
  <li><u>Meanwhile</u> &nbsp; Dice <b>TOMATOES</b> about 3/8 inch, or a 
    bit larger for larger octopus pieces. Dice <b>ONION</b> fairly small. 
    Dice <b>CHILI</b> about 1/4 inch. Chop <b>PARSLEY</b> small. Mix 
    together all <b>Salad Items</b>.</li>
  <li>Squeeze <b>Lemon Juice</b> and mix together all <b>Dressing 
    Items</b>. Note that some people include a teaspoon or two of 
    <a href="mgf_octo1.html#04"><b>Harissa</b></a> in the dressing.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>Octopus</b> into attractive pieces for the salad. This will, 
    again, depend on size. For the baby octopi used for the photo example, 
    the sack was sliced across twice, and the tentacles separated. For 
    larger octopi, leave the tentacle tips fairly long and cut the rest 
    progressively shorter as it gets thicker. Mix into the <b>Salad</b>.
    </li> 
  <li>Prepare <b>Garnishes</b> as desired (any or all, or whatever you 
    prefer). <b>Olives</b> can be whole or halved depending on size. 
    <b>Radishes</b> can be quartered or diced depending on size. 
    <b>Lemon Wedges</b> are optional (there's enough lemon in the 
    dressing for most people).</li>
  <li>When ready to serve, shake up <b>Dressing</b> and tumble with 
    the <b>Salad</b>. Arrange <b>Lettuce Leaves</b> in individual 
    bowls, spoon dressed <b>Salad</b> over and arrange garnishes. 
    For buffet service its better to tear up the leaves and incorporate 
    them into the salad, along with the radishes and halved olives.</li>
  <li>Serve cool, but not chilled - octopus needs to be nearly at room 
    temperature.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Octopus:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for octopus 
  cleaned and de-beaked, as it is normally sold here in California. 
  The   largest you'd want to buy is about 2-1/2 pounds, because they 
  get rather tough in larger sizes. For a large octopus, buy it a day 
  ahead, unpack it, and let it drain into a bowl overnight in the 
  fridge so you know how much you really have. The octopus will probably 
  have been previously frozen, which is good, because freezing tenderizes 
  it a bit so you don't have to pound it. For details see our 
  <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/ingred/seaocto.html"><b>Octopus</b></a> page, and 
  subsequent.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Cooking Octopus:</h3> &nbsp; This depends very 
  much on size, and if they are overcooked, the skin and sucker disks 
  start falling off and they get really grungy looking. 1 to 2 ounce 
  "baby" octopi, as used for the photo example, that will be 35 min max. 
  For larger octopus it can take 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 hours. Only sure way is 
  to check it now and then.</li> 
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili Anaheim:</h3> &nbsp; This is the "long green" 
  chili sold here in Southern California. It may be called "New Mexico" 
  or just "Long Green" in other regions. It is a rather mild chili. For 
  details see our <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html">Chili Page</a>.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Harissa:</h3> &nbsp; This is the hot sauce of 
  Tunisia. Most canned Harissa is pretty awful - best to make it yourself 
  - see our recipe <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/recipes/mjv_harissa1.html"><b>Harissa</b></a>.
