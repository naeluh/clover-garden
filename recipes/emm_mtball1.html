<p>This dish works very well as part of a buffet (make plenty, they'll go 
fast) or as appetizers - a bit of a hassle to make but worth it.</p>

  <b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2-1/4 hrs)
  <ol>
  <li>Break up <b>ROLLS</b> and soak in <b>Water</b> for 15 minutes, then 
    drain and squeeze as dry as possible.</li>
  <li>Grind <b>MEATS</b> fine if not already ground - see 
    <a href="emm_mtball1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a>.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> and <b>PARSLEY</b> fine. Grate <b>LEMON ZEST</b>. 
    Mix together <b>All Meatball items</b> and run the mix through the 
    meat grinder again.</li>
  <li>Set out a foil and oil it as a holding surface. Oil your hands 
    liberally with olive oil and form the <b>Mix</b> into balls. Toss 
    them back and forth between your hands, gently squeezing into shape 
    between tosses. If they start to stick rinse your hands, dry them on 
    a paper towel, take a swig of your beer, re-oil, and continue. These 
    meatballs are quite tender so should be no larger than 1-1/2 inches. 
    Keep the balls as close to the same size as possible for even 
    cooking.</li>
  <li>Bring <b>Stock</b> to a boil. Drop in a couple of balls to make 
    sure they come out well, then do them all in batches so they're not 
    too crowded. After the stock comes back to a boil give them another 
    12 minutes to cook through.  Add water between batches to keep the 
    level up.</li>
  <li>When all balls are done, adjust liquid so you have about 3 cups for 
    a thin sauce, 2 cups for a thick sauce. I prefer it a bit thin, as in 
    the photo, but it depends on how you intend to serve it.</li>
  <li>In a skillet, melt butter over very moderate heat, then stir in 
    flour and continue to fry gently, stirring continuously until it is 
    the color of the lighter caramel cubes in a bag of candy. Slowly stir 
    in some of the stock until smooth and creamy, then stir all into 
    stock. Bring to a simmer, stirring frequently, for a few minutes to 
    thicken.</li>
  <li>Add <b>Capers</b> to the sauce, then gently stir in the meatballs 
    and simmer another 2 minutes.</li>
  <li>This dish is traditionally served with sauerkraut. For typical 
    recipes see <a href="esv_skrautg2.html"><b>Sauerkraut with 
    Apples</b></a> and <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/recipes/esv_skrautg1.html"><b>Sauerkraut with 
    Apples and Wine</b></a>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Meat:</h3> &nbsp; Ratios and types of meat may vary, but pork 
  may not be omitted or it just isn't German.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Option:</h3> &nbsp; In Bavaria, but not much elsewhere 
  in Germany, 3 T of Sour Cream would be stirred into the sauce just before 
  serving.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Prussia:</h3> &nbsp; This Baltic country was inhabited by a people 
  closely related to the Lithuanians and speaking a similar language. 
  The Pagan Prussians were brutally attacked time and again by the 
  Teutonic Knights, a Catholic military order from Germany - until they 
  converted to Christianity. After conversion they continued to be 
  brutally attacked by the Teutonic Knights, who established their main 
  bastion in northern East Prussia. Eventually the Poles and Lithuanians 
  turned the Knights into sausage, but by then there were no Prussians 
  left. The now German Kingdom of Prussia became a military super-power, 
  taking over most of northern Germany and much of Poland, but after 
  WWII their empire was partitioned into German States, Poland, Russian 
  occupied Kaliningrad (northern East Prussia) and Lithuania. So the 
  real Prussians are extinct, and German Prussia is only a name.</li>
