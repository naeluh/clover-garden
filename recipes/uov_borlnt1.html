During the 6 weeks of Great Lent, Eastern Orthodox faithful are forbidden 
meat or dairy products, thus vegan versions of their normal fare have 
been developed.

<p>This borshch is <u>definitely</u> better made a day ahead and 
reheated.</p>

<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr work &nbsp; - &nbsp; but see 
  <a href="uov_borlnt1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a>)
<ol>
<li>If using dried <b>MUSHROOMS</b> soak and simmer as described in 
  <a href="uov_borlnt1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a>.
<li>For <b>Dried Mushrooms</b>, drain, reserving soaking liquid. Chop 
  fairly small and return to soaking liquid. For <b>Fresh Mushrooms</b>,  
  slice about 1/8 inch thick.</li>
<li>Peel <b>CARROTS</b> and slice them about 1/4 inch thick. Peel 
  <b>PARSNIPS</b>. Slice the thick part in half lengthwise, and the 
  really thick part in quarters, then slice crosswise about 1/4 inch 
  thick.</li>
<li>Prepare <b>LEEKS</b>. Chop small, white and light green. Mix with 
  Carrots.</li>
<li>Chop <b>CELERY</b> small. Mix with Carrots.</li>
<li>Core <b>CABBAGE</b> and shred fairly fine.</li>
<li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> 1 minute in boiling water. Quench in cold 
  water, peel and cut into 3/4 inch pieces. Mix with Cabbage.</li>
<li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into 1/2 to 3/4 inch cubes. Hold in 
  cold water until needed.</li>
<li>Peel <b>BEETS</b>. Cut in half lengthwise, then slice crosswise about 
  1/4 inch thick and into sticks about 1/4 inch wide - or as desired.</li> 
<li>Chop <b>ONION</b> medium.</li>
<li>Squeeze <b>LEMON JUICE</b>. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Chop 
  <b>DILL</b> small. Mix all.</li>
</ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/3 hrs)
<ol start="12">
<li>Into an adequate pot, place <b>Vegetables #1 mix</b> and 4 cups 
  <b>Water</b>. If using Dried Mushrooms, strain out the soaking liquid 
  and add it to the pot, reserving the mushrooms. Bring to a boil and 
  simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Meanwhile: &nbsp; In a saut&eacute; pan, heat 1 T <b>Oil</b> and fry 
  sliced <b>Mushrooms</b> (fresh or dried) stirring for about 5 minutes 
  or until fresh mushrooms start to give up their water. Remove with a 
  slotted spoon and add to the pot.</li>
<li>Add 1 T <b>Oil</b> to the pan and fry <b>Onions</b> until golden. 
  Remove with a slotted spoon, leaving the oil behind, and set aside. 
  Stir the <b>Beets</b> into the oil and fry stirring constantly until 
  they are coated with oil and glossy. Remove from the oil with a 
  slotted spoon and set aside.</li>
<li>After 30 minutes, Stir <b>Beets</b> into the pot. Drain 
  <b>Potatoes</b> and stir into the pot along with <b>Vegetables 
  #2 mix</b> and <b>Tomato Paste</b>. Bring to a boil and simmer another 
  45 minutes.</li> 
<li>After 45 minutes, stir in <b>Onions</b> and simmer another 5 minutes.
  </li>
<li>Stir in <b>Finish mix</b> and take off the heat.</li>
<li>Serve hot. You can provide <b>Sour Cream</b> on the side for any 
  who want it, but for Eastern Orthodox, it is not allowed between 
  Cheesefare Sunday and Pascha.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; Here we have two ways to go - dried 
  (traditional) or fresh. For fresh I would use 8 ounces of the small 
  King Trumpet mushrooms now commonly available here in Southern 
  California (Hokto brand in 9.5 ounce packages), but white or crimini 
  mushrooms could be used. The pattern recipe called for 1-1/4 ounces 
  dried Boletus (Porcini). These must be soaked for several hours 
  (or overnight) in water to cover. They are then simmered in the 
  soaking water for about an hour. The pattern recipe called for a 
  mere 1 hour soak and 15 minutes simmer, but the borshch that made 
  wasn't really edible until reheated the following day.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> In Russia and other Eastern Orthodox regions Sunflower 
  Oil would be used. During Lent, the church listed cooking oils as 
  banned, but this new oil from North America was not on the list, so 
  became very popular. I rarely have Sunflower Oil because it goes rancid 
  so quickly, so I use Pure Olive Oil (not virgin). For details see our
