Sour soups of this type are very popular in Russia, made with Fish, 
Meat, Sausages or Mushrooms. This fish version is adapted from one by 
a Moscow company cafeteria cook (see <a href="uof_solya1.html#06"><b>Note-6</b></a>).

<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min - excluding making Fish Stock)
<ol>
<li>Make the <b>FISH STOCK</b> if you don't already have it.</li>
<li>Cut <b>FISH</b> into bite size pieces.</li>
<li>Chop <b>ONION</b> fine. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine. Mix.</li>
<li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> 1 minute in boiling water, quench in cold 
  water, peel and cut into 3/4 inch pieces.</li>
<li>Chop <b>PICKLES</b> fairly small. Drain <b>CAPERS</b>. Mix, along 
  with <b>Pickle Juice</b>.</li>
<li>For Garnish, slice <b>LEMON</b> into thin half slices. Chop 
  <b>DILL</b> and <b>SCALLIONS</b> small if using.</li>
</ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min)
<ol start="7">
<li>In a suitable sauce pan, heat <b>Olive Oil</b>. Stir in 
  <b>Onion mix</b> and fry stirring over moderate heat until onions are 
  translucent, but not browned.</li>
<li>Add <b>Wine</b> to the pan and simmer it down over moderate heat 
  until it has almost completely evaporated.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Tomato Paste</b> until it is well distributed, then pour 
  in <b>Fish Stock</b>. Stir in <b>Tomatoes</b>, <b>Bay Leaf</b>, and 
  <b>Paprika</b>. Bring to a simmer and stir in <b>Pickle mix</b>. 
  Simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Fish</b>, bring back to a boil and simmer 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Olives</b>, <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. Bring back to 
  a simmer and take off the heat.</li>
<li>Serve hot, garnished with <b>Lemon Slices</b> (always) and 
  <b>Dill Scallion mix</b> (if desired). For buffet service, I cut the 
  lemon into quarter slices and spread it and the herbs on top, to be 
  mixed in as people ladle soup out.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Fish Stock:</h3> &nbsp; It is always best to buy your fish whole 
  (the only way you can be sure you're getting the kind of fish you're 
  paying for), and the heads, fins, bones, and sometimes skins can be 
  used to make excellent fish stock. You can have the fish man scale and 
  clean the fish (done free in all the Asian markets here in Southern 
  California). For details see our recipe <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/recipes/gof_stock1.html">
  <b>Making Fish Stock</b></a>.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Fish:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for Cod, but any 
  reasonably mild fish that holds together well with wet cooking will 
  work fine. Cod is rather scarce here in Southern California, so the 
  photo example was made with Tilapia, because that's what I had on 
  hand. For guests, I'd usually make it using 
  <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_pompcz.html"><b>Golden Pompano</b></a>.</li>
<li id="#03">
  <h3>Pickles:</h3> &nbsp;  These should be fairly sour Dill Pickles, as 
  they are supposed to sour the soup.</li>
<li id="#04">
  <h3>Paprika:</h3> &nbsp; Please, real Hungarian or Spanish sweet 
  Paprika, not that sawdust flavored stuff from the supermarket.</li>
<li id="#05">
  <h3>Olives:</h3> &nbsp; Most modern recipes call for pitted green 
  olives, but older cookbooks call for black, which you pit yourself. 
  If using Black Olives, they should be salt cured Mediterranean type, 
  not canned salad olives.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe, credited to Soviet company 
  cafeteria (stolovaya) cook Svetlana Vladislavevna, who was noted for 
  her soups. It was published by 
  <a href="https://jennifereremeeva.com/category/russia/"><b>Jennifer 
  Eremeeva</b></a>, who reports that Svetlana used a lot more oil and 
  a big pat of butter, so add those if you want true Soviet style. 
  This recipe is very close to the one in Lynn Visson's "The Compete 
  Russian Cookbook" (1982), but I found Mrs. Eremeeva's easier for me 
  to proportion.</li>
