  <b><u>Chicken</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (3+ hrs - 20 min work - can be done 
    2 days before use)
  <br>This step fakes up having leftover Tandoori Chicken (<i>tikka</i> 
    means pieces, <i>masala</i> for the spicy sauce)
  <ol>
  <li>Prepare <b>CHICKEN</b> as described in <a href="imc_chktikm1.html#01">
    <b>Note-1</b></a>.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Marinade items</b> and massage into <b>Chicken</b>. Let 
    marinate in the fridge for at least 2 hours or up to 12 hours, 
    massaging now and then. I marinade in a sealed plastic bag which 
    makes handling and massaging very easy.</li> 
  <li>Shake off excess Marinade from <b>Chicken</b>. In a preheated 
    broiler (on a rack), on the grill, or in a frying pan (with a little 
    oil), roast <b>Chicken</b> until blackened in spots (just browned 
    well if fried in a pan). I use the broiler as that is very effective 
    and takes the least attention.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>Chicken</b> into chunks, about 1-1/2 inches on a side. 
    At this point the Chicken can be refrigerated overnight.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Sauce</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min - can be done 3 days before use)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> fine.</li>
  <li>In a coverable saut&eacute; pan large enough for the whole recipe, 
    heat <b>Butter</b> and fry Onions over moderate heat until there is 
    a fair amount of dark brown, but no black.</li>
  <li><u>Meanwhile</u>: &nbsp; Grind together all <b>SPICES</b>.</li>
  <li>Prepare <b>TOMATO PUR&Eacute;E</b> as needed (see 
    <a href="imc_chktikm1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a>).</li>
  <li> Grate <b>GINGER</b>. Chop <b>CHILI</b> fine. Mix both with 
    Tomato Pur&eacute;e.</li>
  <li><u>When Onions are ready</u>: &nbsp; Stir in <b>Spice mix</b>, 
    <b>Tomato mix</b>, <b>Cream</b> and <b>Water</b>. Bring to a simmer 
    and simmer about 5 minutes. At this point the sauce can be 
    held refrigerated in a sealed container for up to 3 days, waiting 
    for the chicken.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Finish</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min - can be started 3 days 
    ahead)
  <ol start="11">
  <li>Heat Sauce to a simmer. Stir in <b>Chicken</b> and continue to 
    simmer until Chicken is cooked through and tender - this can vary, 
    but will probably be about 30 minutes. Adjust liquid as needed by 
    adding boiled water or simmering uncovered. The sauce should finish 
    quite liquid. If you will be reheating before serving, be sure the 
    chicken is not overcooked. The Masala can now be cooled and 
    refrigerated for up to three days in a sealed container.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>Cilantro</b> small.</li>
  <li>Reheat the <b>Masala</b> gently to a simmer if it has been held 
    cold. Check for <b>Salt</b>.</li>
  <li>Take off heat. Stir in <b>Cilantro</b> and <b>Pepper</b>.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with Naan Bread or steamed Basmati rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is skinless, boneless 
  and fat removed. Julie Sahni's recipe calls for breasts pounded to 1/2 
  to 3/4 inch thick. For better flavor, I use deboned and skinless thigh 
  meat with shallow slashes on the rough side. Most recipes for Tandoori 
  Chicken call for slashes.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Yogurt:</h3> &nbsp; Some sources call for "Plain Greek Yogurt", 
  others call for "Plain Full Fat (not Greek)", so take your pick. I 
  used Trader Joe's "Plain Greek" which is just a little thicker than 
  the regular yogurt I use.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; I use Pure Olive Oil (not virgin), but Peanut Oil, 
  Avocado Oil or a similar durable high temperature oil can be used.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Tomato Pur&eacute;e:</h3> &nbsp; This can be 
  obtained several ways. Simplest is a 14 oz can of tomato pur&eacute;e. 
  You can also use a 14 oz can of Diced or Crushed Tomatoes and a 
  tablespoon of Tomato Paste, pur&eacute;ed together in a food processor, 
  or 1 pound Fresh Tomatoes and 1 Tablespoon Tomato Paste, pur&eacute;ed 
  in a food processor.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Do Ahead:</h3> &nbsp; Making this recipe can be spread over as 
  many as 6 days. First make the sauce, up to stirring in the Chicken. 
  This can be refrigerated in a sealed container for up to 3 days. Cook 
  the chicken and simmer it in the reheated sauce, making 
  sure it isn't over-done. This can now be kept refrigerated in a 
  sealed container for another 3 days.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>History:</h3> &nbsp; Many claim this recipe originated in the 
  United Kingdom, particularly in Scotland around 1971. Others, 
  including &uuml;ber expert Julie Sahni, attribute it to Punjab, 
  possibly a way to use up leftover tandoori chicken (chicken is very 
  expensive in India). There is a recipe for Chicken Masala in Mrs 
  Balbir Singh's <i>Indian Cookery</i>, published in England in 1961, 
  which is close to current practice. This recipe is thought by 
  historians to be the ultimate source. I have the 1973 revision in 
  which it is called Makhani Murgh. Mrs Singh was writing in Punjab, 
  not Scotland. My recipe here is based mainly on elements from Julie 
  Sahni and  Mrs. Balbir Singh. For Indian cooking there are no sources 
  more authoritative.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Variations:</h3> &nbsp; Recipes vary, and today Tikka Masala is also 
  made with Lamb and Fish instead of Chicken, and with Paneer Cheese for 
  a vegetarian version.</li>
