Next to these, the jarred marinaded mushrooms from the grocery stand 
as pale ghosts. This recipe is sufficient to fill a 14 ounce jar, but feel 
free to double or triple it.

<b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (8+ hours - 45 min work)
<ol>
  <li>Clean <b>MUSHROOMS</b> as needed. Trim stems flush with bottoms, 
    put them in a nonreactive bowl, sprinkle <b>LEMON JUICE</b> over and 
    tumble them to coat well. Set aside for about 15 minutes tumbling a 
    couple times.</li>
  <li>Place the <b>Mushrooms</b> in a stainless or enameled saucepan and 
    pour in enough <b>Water</b> so they just start to float upward (they 
    will sink down as they cook). Bring to a boil, add <b>SALT</b>, 
    cover and let simmer for about 10 minutes stirring once.</li>
  <li>Fish out the <b>Mushrooms</b> with a slotted spoon and chill with 
    cold running water. Set aside.</li>
  <li>Let any debris in the pot sink to the bottom, then pour off into a 
    measuring cup 2/3 cup of the liquid - discard the rest and clean the 
    saucepan.</li>
  <li>Put the 2/3 cup of liquid back in the clean sauce pan, add all 
    <b>Marinade items</b>. Bring to a boil and simmer covered for about 5 
    minutes, then let cool</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GARLIC</b> thin, chop <b>DILL</b> quite coarse including the 
    stems.</li> 
  <li>Pack <b>Mushrooms</b> in a jar that just fits, interlaced with the 
    <b>Dill</b> and <b>Garlic</b>. Pour in the <b>Marinade</b> which 
    should just cover, then top with a tablespoon of <b>OLIVE OIL</b> to 
    seal. Refrigerate overnight (<a href="uav_mushmar1.html#03">see Note-3</a>).</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Mushrooms:</h3> Small white button mushrooms that 
  are still closed (gills not exposed) work well. You can also use Crimini 
  mushrooms for a more intense flavor, or others that may be available. 
  If they are larger than about 1-1/4 inch, cut them in half.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Tarragon:</h3> Don't over-do it - use a single 
  moderate size sprig. Lacking Tarragon you can substitute Tarragon 
  Vinegar for the white wine vinegar.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Marinating:</h3> The mushrooms will be ready to eat in 8 hours 
  or so but continue to improve for a few days. They would keep in the 
  refrigerator for a month or so if they hadn't all been eaten.</li>
