This potato salad is a little different in including canned sardines - 
but Norwegians include canned sardines in just about anything they 
can. The Sardines do work very well in this recipe.

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cook in boiling water until just done. 
    This is when a sharp skewer will go through the center of the 
    largest one without hitting a hard spot.</li>
  <li>Cool <b>Potatoes</b> thoroughly, then cut into 1/4 inch slices 
    with a very thin sharp knife.</li>
  <li>Core <b>APPLES</b>, cut lengthwise into quarters (or 6ths if 
    larger, or according to your preference) and slice fairly thin. Hold 
    in cold water acidulated with Citric Acid or Lemon Juice until needed.
    </li>
  <li>Drain oil from <b>SARDINES</b>. Split them open and pull out the 
    backbone (yes, it's a great source of calcium, but some people are 
    put off by the crunchiness). Break them into pieces about 1/2 inch 
    long. Optionally, the sardines can be left whole and served as a 
    garnish.</li>
  <li>Make Dressing: &nbsp; Grate <b>LEMON</b> for zest, then squeeze 
    for juice. Slice <b>SCALLIONS</b> thin, white and green parts. 
    Chop <b>DILL</b> fine.  Mix all <b>Dressing items</b> in a 
    jar.</li>
  <li>Place <b>Apples</b> in the bottom of an oversized mixing bowl. 
    Layer <b>Potatoes</b> over, then <b>Sardines</b>. Shake up jar of 
    <b>Dressing</b> to blend well, then pour over the top. Gently 
    toss the salad until well distributed. Having the Apple slices on 
    the bottom makes it easy to scoop under then and lift everything 
    without breaking the potatoes when you start to toss.</li>
  <li>Let rest in the fridge for a few hours if you have time. Serve 
    cool, garnished with <b>Dill Sprigs</b> and <b>Lemon Wedges</b>.
    </li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; Choose smaller Red 
  Potatoes which slice better after cooking. This is one place you 
  can use Yukon Gold type potatoes, if you like the flavor (I prefer 
  the red) and are careful to not overcook them. For   details see our 
  <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/ingred/ns_potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Sardines:</h3> &nbsp; This would be two 4.3 
  ounce cans packed in plain olive or vegetable oil. The pattern recipe 
  calls for "Norwegian Sardines", but good luck with that. Most of 
  Norway's canneries have been torn out to make way for oil refineries. 
  Sardines from Portugal, Poland, Canada and Thailand are good. Try to 
  avoid Moroccan sardines which can be very uneven in quality and often 
  have an angry flavor. For details see our
