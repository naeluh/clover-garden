Chicken with Lemon and olives is one of the most famous Moroccan dishes, 
with many distinct variations on the theme. This delicious dish is easily 
adaptable to table or buffet service (see <a href="mmc_chklem1.html#04">Service</a>).

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (55 min + marinate time 1+ hrs)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>CHICKEN</b> into the size serving pieces you want, perhaps 
    1-1/2 inch pieces for buffet service, somewhat larger for table 
    service - they will shrink.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> fine. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop fine.
    Mix.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>CILANTRO</b> and <b>PARSLEY</b> fine. Mix. Chop enough 
    for both instances and divide in half <u>right now</u>, so you don't 
    forget.</li> 
  <li>Squeeze 3 T <b>LEMON JUICE</b>, enough for both instances, and 
    divide it in half <u>right now</u> so you don't forget.</li>
  <li>Peel the pulp from 1 <b>Preserved Lemon</b>. Chop the pulp and add 
    it to the Marinade half of the <b>Lemon Juice</b>. Cut the Rind into 
    narrow strips and reserve for Garnish.</li> 
  <li>Grind <b>Pepper</b> and <b>Cumin</b> in your spice grinder.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Marinade</b> items and massage into <b>Chicken</b>. 
    Set aside for an hour or however much time you can spare, or 
    refrigerate overnight.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>Pour <b>Chicken</b> and <b>all Marinade</b> into a large sauce pan 
    or spacious saut&eacute; pan. Stir in the <b>Stock</b> and bring 
    to a boil. Cover and simmer for about 40 minutes or until the 
    Chicken is tender.</li>
  <li>Uncover the <b>Chicken</b> and reduce liquid at a fast simmer 
    until at a light sauce consistency.</li>
  <li>Stir in the <b>Finish items</b>. Bring back to a simmer for about 
    2 minutes.</li>
  <li>Garnish with strips of <b>Preserved Lemon Rind</b> and 
    <b>Olives</b>. Serve hot with Rice or Couscous - I usually serve 
    with rice, keeping the sauce fairy liquid.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for skinless, 
  boneless chicken. I always use thigh and/or leg meat for better flavor 
  and texture than the cardboard breast meat we get in North America. 
  The pattern recipe calls for a whole 3-1/2 pound chicken, but I use 
  skinned and boned, and make up the favor using strong chicken stock 
  made from the skin and bones instead of water. This makes for easy 
  serving and prevents resentment over who got the best pieces.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Preserved Lemon:</h3> &nbsp; This is an essential 
  North African ingredient. Jars of Preserved Lemon can be found in 
  markets serving North African, Levantine or Middle Eastern communities 
  - or much better, make your own per our recipe 
  <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/recipes/miv_lemonpres1.html"><b>Preserved Lemons</b></a>. It's easy 
  but it takes a few weeks for fermentation. Many recipes use only the 
  rind, but the pulp and rind are used separately in this recipe.</li> 
<li id="03">
  <h3>Olives:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is with pits - about 
  3-1/2 ounces if pitted. These should be large green or purple 
  Mediterranean olives. Pit them or not, as you wish. I usually use 
  purple Kalamatas, which I can buy already pitted. Some recipes call 
  for Brown Moroccan Olives (much smaller), but those aren't common 
  around here. For details see our 
  <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/ingred/olives.html"><b>Olives</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Service:</h3> &nbsp; As written, this   recipe is for table 
  service, but it is easily adapted to buffet. Though it is essentially 
  all chicken, leg and thigh meat can be had 
  at a good price, as well as leg quarters with the skin, bones and 
  off-cuts needed to make a good chicken stock. Make ahead, but reheat 
  and stir in the Finish items just before serving. Also, just stir in 
  the Garnishes. You could consider cutting the Olives in half crosswise 
  if rather large, or breaking them if you have to pit them yourself.
  </li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Some recipes cook the 
  olives, but this is reported to make them bitter, so we use them 
  as a garnish. Various published recipes use whole chickens or separated 
  joints, rubbed with the marinade, but others call for just breasts. 
  Breasts are easy to cut into pieces, but have no other positive 
  attributes, being dry, flavorless and stringy. They have been slowly 
  going out of style in North America for some years now.</li>
