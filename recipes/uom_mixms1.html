<p>This mixed meat Solyanka is even better rested overnight and reheated. 
The mix of meats and their proportions can be changed as desired.</p>

<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min - excluding making Beef Stock)
<ol>
<li>Make the <b>BEEF STOCK</b> if you don't have it on hand.</li>
<li>Slice <b>KIDNEY</b> about 3/8 inch thick. Trim off all fat, membranes 
  and plumbing. Cut into largish bite size pieces.</li>
<li>Dice <b>HAM</b> and <b>FRANKFURTER</b> about 3/8 inch or however 
  you like. Mix.</li>
<li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> small.</li>
<li>Scald <b>TOMATOES</b> 1 minute in boiling water, quench in cold 
  water, peel and cut into 1/2 inch pieces.</li>
<li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into about 1/2 inch cubes. Put them 
  in a pan of cold water, bring to a boil and simmer until almost cooked 
  through. Drain and add to Tomatoes. This pre-cook helps keep the broth 
  clear.</li>
<li>Cut <b>PICKLES</b> into matchsticks about 1 inch long. Drain 
  <b>CAPERS</b>. Pit <b>OLIVES</b> if needed and slice. Mix all with 
  Tomatoes.</li>
<li>Drain <b>MUSHROOMS</b>. Cut in half if large. Mix with Tomatoes.</li>
<li>Cut two 1 inch thick slices from the <b>LEMON</b>. Mix with 
  Tomatoes along with <b>Tomato Paste</b>.</li> 
<li>Chop <b>Dill</b> and <b>Parsley</b> small for Garnish. Mix.</li>
</ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr)
<ol start="9">
<li>Lightly dust <b>Kidneys</b> in <b>Flour</b>.</li>
<li>In a suitable skillet heat 1-1/2 T <b>Oil</b>. Fry Kidney slices 
  until lightly browned. Remove and set aside.</li>
<li>Scrape excess debris out of the skillet. Add 1 T <b>Oil</b> and fry 
  <b>Onion</b> stirring until lightly browned. Add to the <b>Kidneys</b>.
  </li>
<li>In a pot or large sauce pan, bring <b>Beef Stock</b> to a boil. Stir 
  in <b>Kidney mix</b>, <b>Ham mix</b> and <b>Bay Leaf</b>. Bring back 
  to a boil and simmer about 15 minutes.  
<li>Stir in <b>Tomato mix</b>, bring back to a boil and simmer another 
  10 minutes.</li>
<li>Season with <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. Be cautious with the 
  Salt, as some will have already come from the Olives and Ham.</li>
<li>Serve hot, garnished with <b>Dill mix</b>. Note that some 
  ingredients sink to the bottom, and others float, so you have to 
  be careful when ladling to get a bit of everything. It becomes much 
  more even when reheated a day later.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef Stock:</h3> &nbsp; If you don't have this made from beef bones 
  and offcuts, you can make a batch by our recipe 
  <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/recipes/uom_beefstock1.html"><b>Boiled Beef &amp; Stock</b></a> 
  and have a big chunk of beef left for other recipes. For further 
  details see our recipe <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/recipes/goo_stock1.html"><b>Soup Stock / 
  Broth</b></a>.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Beef Kidneys:</h3> &nbsp; This is an important part of the soup, 
  but not much available in the big chain supermarkets. Ethnic markets 
  of many kinds have them. For details see our 
  <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/ingred/ab_kidnez.html"><b>Beef Kidneys</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="#03">
  <h3>Sausages:</h3> &nbsp; Various sausages are used. The pattern recipe 
  called for Frankfurters (presumably Russian style), and the photo 
  example was made with Veal Frankfurters. Polish Kielbasa is also 
  often used.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; I use White Rose, which hold up well in 
  recipes of this kind. Avoid Yukon Gold types which disintegrate to 
  mush if cooked a little beyond the minimum. Potatoes were not in the 
  pattern recipe, but I found they work very well with the wild flavors 
  of this soup. For details see our <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/ingred/ns_potato.html">
  <b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="#05">
  <h3>Pickles:</h3> &nbsp;  These should be fairly sour Dill Pickles, 
  as they are supposed to sour the soup.</li>
<li id="#06">
  <h3>Olives:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is without pits. Most modern recipes 
  call for pitted green olives, but older cookbooks call for black,
   which you pit yourself. If using Black Olives, they should be salt 
   cured Mediterranean type, not canned salad olives. For the photo 
   example, I bought small, pitted Kalamatas.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe called for Butter, but that 
  proved very difficult due to its low smoke point, especially with the 
  kidneys. It is difficult enough to see their browning point without 
  browned butter interfering. A faster, higher temperature fry works 
  much better. Avocado oil, which has a buttery taste, is a good 
  compromise, but Pure Olive Oil (not Virgin) works fine.</li>
