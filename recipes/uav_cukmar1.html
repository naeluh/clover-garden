This is a very popular zakuska (appetizer) in Russia, served by the piece 
rather than as a salad. This is a "quick" version - for a "do ahead" 
(2 weeks) version see our recipe <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/recipes/uav_cuksal1.html"><b>Salted 
Cucumbers</b></a>.

<p>You can serve in a bowl with toothpicks, or, my favorite, on cut 
squares of black bread (see <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/recipes/uav_cukmar1x.html#gal">
<b>Photo</b></a>). See also <a href="uav_cukmar1.html#03"><b>Comments</b></a>.</p>

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (4 hr - 22 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut ends from <b>CUCUMBERS</b> and cut into thick sticks about 2 
    inches long, or however long fits in your cucumbers without waste. 
    For smallish Persian Cucumbers I quarter them lengthwise and cut 
    in make 2 to 3 cuts crosswise, depending on length. Put them in a 
    non-reactive bowl to be marinated.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> and chop very fine. Strip leaves from 
    <b>PARSLEY</b> and chop them fairly fine (measure is after chopping). 
    Mix together all <b>Marinade items</b> and whip it all together well. 
    Pour over <b>Cucumbers</b> and tumble to coat well.</li>
  <li>Let marinate at room temperature for at least 3 hours, tumbling 
    now and then, then refrigerate until well chilled.</li>
  <li>Drain the <b>Cucumbers</b> and serve as appetizers, with toothpicks 
    or on squares of black bread, or however you want (see 
    <a href="uav_cukmar1.html#02"><b>Serving</b></a>).</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Cucumbers:</h3> &nbsp; If at all possible, use 
  narrow unwaxed cucumbers that need not be peeled or seeded (Persian, 
  Japanese, European. etc.). If you must use the standard green blimps, 
  peel them and seed them. Weight given is after peeling and seeding. 
  The photo example was made with Persians, which are very widely 
  available here in Los Angeles.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; In Russia, these are often 
  served in a bowl, to be taken as desired. Separate bowls of Honey and 
  Sour Cream are provided for dipping. Served on Black Bread, no dips 
  are needed, but the bread may be coated with Sour Cream.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe is from Russian immegrant ladies 
  in New York in the 1980s. It is from a collection aiming to preserve 
  a culture that was at risk of being lost, and to do so as authenticly 
  as possible.</li>
