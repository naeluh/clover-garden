Observant Jews are forbidden to work on the Sabbath, and that includes 
lighting fires and cooking. The work-around is stews set up before 
sundown the day before, and left to cook slowly for as long as 18 hours.

<p>Since few people today have a big pile of culinary grade hot ashes 
around the house, electric slow cookers and similar devices are now 
used, or a very slow oven. This recipe is sized to just fit into a 
5 quart slow cooker.</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Soak <b>CHICKPEAS</b> at least 7 hours, drain and rinse.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>BEEF</b> into chunks (see <a href="hmm_sefrina1.html#01">Note-1</a>). Bring a 
    big pot of water to a rolling boil, add all the <b>Beef</b> and 
    <b>Bones</b>, bring back to a boil and cook about 3 minutes. Drain 
    and rinse. This will make for a clearer broth.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> but leave whole.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GARLIC</b> thin.</li>
  <li>Load the slow cooker: <b>Beans</b> on the bottom, then <b>Beef</b> 
    followed by <b>Bones</b>, then <b>Potatoes</b>. Arrange <b>EGGS</b> 
    if including them (see <a href="hmm_sefrina1.html#02">Note-2</a>), then all 
    <b>Seasoning items</b>.</li>
  <li>Pour <b>Boiling Water</b> over it all, cover and turn the cooker up 
    to high. When it reaches a simmer turn it down to low. Cooking time 
    should be at least 8 hours.</li>
  <li>I suppose the prohibition on work would dictate the pot just be set 
    out without further ado (apparntly that doesn't count as work) - all 
    the parts break up easily with a spoon. Pagans (senso lato includes 
    Christians) have God/desses who aren't such control freaks so we can 
    serve it up any time or way we please - Reform Jews can go either 
    way. Goes well with bread or rice (see <a href="hmm_sefrina1.html#03">Note-3</a>).</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Use a tough stewing cut preferably with just a 
  little fat shot through it for texture. Weight is for boneless, but 
  some bones is normal in Morocco, and also some extra bones for better 
  stock. Beef is often cut into 1/2 pound pieces, but you can cut them 
  smaller if you like - but not too small or they'll disintegrate.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Eggs:</h3> &nbsp; These are raw eggs in the shell. In Morocco they 
  are added to the stew, but I prefer the Tunisian method where the eggs 
  are separately cooked so I can have as many as I want. They are colored 
  by tea leaves, onion skins, coffee grounds or a combination of these 
  and should still be cooked as long as the stew for color and texture.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Rice:</h3> &nbsp; In Essaouria, homeland of this recipe, rice 
  (for this size recipe 1-1/2 cups) would be partially cooked (10 
  minutes), stirred with a little oil, salt, pepper and parsley, and 
  spooned into a loosely woven cloth bag, all before sundown. Near 
  serving time the bag of rice would be stuffed into the stew to finish 
  cooking and then be served with the stew. You'd need something a lot 
  bigger than a 5 quart slow cooker for this method. Better to use an 
  Asian Rice Cooker, they'll keep the rice warm for more than a day.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Leftovers:</h3> &nbsp; Cut the potatoes into smaller chunks, break 
  up the meat a bit, add some tomato sauce, heat and serve as a pasta 
  sauce.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>My Method:</h3> &nbsp; We Pagans are exept from Jewish 
  Sabbath laws, and I'm generally cooking for an evening event rather 
  than for the next day's lunch. I do things differently.
  <ol>
  <li>I put bones and off-cuts into the slow cooker the previous evening 
    and cook all night. In the morning I strain out and discard the bones 
    and debris, then defat the stock using a gravy separator. I clean the 
    cooker so it's ready to make the stew.</li>
  <li>I start the eggs mixed with tea leaves and/or onion skins and keep 
    at a low simmer until the stew is nearly done.</li>
  <li>After parboiling the beef (see main method) I return it to the 
    cleaned pot and add 4 cups of stock (or 1/2 stock and 1/2 water if 
    the stock is quite strong). I bring it to a boil and keep at a high 
    simmer for 10 minutes or more. This cooking gives the slow cooker a 
    head start.</li>
  <li>Meanwhile I start the slow cooker heating on high and put in the 
    beans. When the beef is thoroughly heated I pour it and the stock over 
    the beans, then add the potatoes and seasonings. I cook on high until 
    it's bubbling, then turn to low. It should be done in 6 to 8 hours 
    depending on the size and toughness of the beef lumps.</li>
  <li>I peel the eggs and put them into the stew pot for the last hour or 
    so.</li>
  <li>Finally I stir it up a bit and serve.</li>
  </ol>
<li id="06">
  <h3>History</h3> &nbsp; Stews of this sort originate from both 
  Sephardic and Ashkenazic Jews. This one was taken to Morocco by 
  Sephardi driven out of Spain and Portugal. Other names and closely 
  related dishes are Adafina (Spain, Maghreb), Hamin, Chamin (Sephardi), 
  Cholent (Eastern Europe), and Shalent (Western Europe). The Cozido 
  of Portugal and the Cocido of Spain are derived from the Sephardic 
  Sefrina / Adafina but do not conform to Jewish food laws or Sabbath 
  prohibitions. Observant Jews. Forbidden to cook on the Sabbath 
  (cooking is considered work) would prepare a one-pot meal on Friday 
  before sundown, which could be left to stay warm in the kitchen embers 
  and feed the family lunch the next day. As with most traditional 
  recipes, ingredients vary. Of course, we Pagans can finish up the stew 
  on the day it is to be served, regardless of what that day might be. 
  Our Gods and Goddesses are on call all day every day (or as they 
  please), and permit work on any day.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Sundown</h3> &nbsp; Many ancient cultures in Europe and the Near 
  East, considered the next day to begin on Sundown of the current day, 
  thus for Jews, the Sabbath starts at sundown on Friday, and is over 
  at sundown on Saturday - party time!</li>
