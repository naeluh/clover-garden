Pickled eggs are popular through the British Isles and on through 
Central and Eastern Europe. They'd be essential for a Pub themed party. 
For some popular variations, see <a href="gad_eggpkl1.html#06"><b>Note-6</b></a>.

Back in the 1970s, many working men's bars here in Southern California had 
a big jar of pickled eggs. I haven't seen that for many years, but I 
haven't been in a lot of working men's bars in recent times, so some may 
still have them.

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp;  (1-1/4 hrs - 30 min work + 2 days age)
  <ol>
  <li>Pierce <b>EGGS</b> if desired (<a href="gad_eggpkl1.html#01">Note-1</a>). For 
    maximum peelability, set them in a pot of boiling water for about 
    20 seconds (I do them 3 at a time), then place them in the cold water 
    they will be boiled in. Use a roomy pan - one layer is best, but two 
    will be OK. Fill with cold  water to about 3/4 inch over the eggs.
    </li>
  <li>Bring <b>Eggs</b> to a boil over high heat. Give them about 45 
    seconds, then turn off the heat. Let them sit for about 15 minutes. 
    </li>
  <li>Peel the shells from <b>Eggs</b>. &nbsp; <u>Important</u>: peel 
    them hot. After 15 minutes, the temperature will still be around 
    190&deg;F/88&deg;C. If it gets cool enough so you can hold your 
    fingers in it, you will start to have trouble peeling them. Set a 
    strainer in the sink under cold running water. One by one, bring out 
    the eggs with your <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/ke/ke_eggprc.html">Egg Spoon</a>, 
    quickly cool under cold water so you can handle them. Tap them on a 
    hard surface in several places, hard enough to crack the shell and 
    break the membrane, but not too hard. Peel off the shells, using 
    the cold running water to help.</li>
  <li>Size your <b>Pickle Liquid</b>. Place peeled <b>Eggs</b> in the 
    sterile jar they will be pickled in. Pour in enough water to fill 
    the jar, then pour it out and measure it. Make Pickling Liquid to 
    a couple ounces more. This should be <b>Vinegar</b> and <b>Water</b> 
    in a ratio of about 1 cup to 1/3 cup (75% vinegar - presuming 
    vinegar at 5% acidity).</li>
  <li>Pour <b>Pickling Liquid</b> into your pan. Add <b>Spices mix</b> 
    and bring to a boil. Simmer for a few minutes, then add the 
    <b>Eggs</b> and bring back to a boil (see <a href="gad_eggpkl1.html#04">Note-4</a>).
    </li>
  <li>Using your egg spoon, place the hot <b>Eggs</b> into their jar, 
    then pour in the hot <b>Pickling Liquid</b>. Also see 
    <a href="gad_eggpkl1.html#05">Note-5</a>.</li>
  <li>Screw on the lid, but not quite tight, any gasses produced need to 
    escape.</li>
  <li>You can start eating the eggs in 48 hours, if you can wait that 
    long. Made by this recipe, they will keep for at least a couple of 
    weeks at a cool room temperature - much longer in the fridge.</li>
  </ol>

<b>NOTES:</b>

<ol>
<li id="01">
  <b>Eggs:</b> &nbsp; I favor "Medium" eggs, but 
  "Large" are fine too. Two dozen Mediums will fit loosely in a 1/2 gallon 
  jar, Large, a little more snuggly. Piercing the egg shells, using a 
  needle or an <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/ke/ke_eggprc.html">Egg Piercer</a> is 
  optional. This step has little effect on peelability, but will help 
  keep eggs with invisible cracks from bursting.</li>
<li id="02">
  <b>Vinegar:</b> &nbsp; The most common vinegars 
  for pickling eggs are Distilled White Vinegar and Apple Cider 
  Vinegar, but Malt Vinegar and other vinegars are also used. They 
  should be 5% acidic for the amount of water given in this recipe.</li>
<li id="03">
  <b>Chilis:</b> &nbsp; These can be dried or fresh. 
  For dried I use 2 tiny but very hot Thai type chilis, cap end removed 
  (my Black Cobra chili plant ripens them orange rather than red). For 
  fresh, I'd use red Fresno chilis or red ripe Jalapenos, split in half 
  and not seeded. Use your own best judgement here.</li>
<li id="04">
  <b>Scalding:</b> &nbsp; The first batch of pickled 
  eggs I ever made, I used cider vinegar, and didn't do this final scald. 
  They were delicious, but could give Ex-lax a run for its money, and I 
  mean run - immediate, urgent, but surprisingly gentle. I can not 
  guarantee you would get the same result, so scald before packing in 
  the jar to prevent this.</li>
<li id="05">
  <b>Danger:</b> &nbsp; Some older recipes suggest 
  using a toothpick to poke a deep hole in the boiled egg for better 
  penetration of the pickling fluid. This has resulted in cases of (very 
  unpleasant and/or fatal) botulism poisoning. This is due to 
  <i>Clostridium botulinum</i> bacteria propagating in the yolk (source 
  US CDC (Center for Disease Control)) There is no botulism danger from 
  unpoked eggs.</li>
<li id="06">
  <b>Variations:</b> &nbsp; Naturally, there are many.
  <ul>
  <li><b>Spices:</b> &nbsp; Just about any possible mix of pickling 
    spices has been used. This subject is wide open.</li>
  <li><b>Red Beets:</b> &nbsp; The eggs are often colored bright red 
    by inclusion of beet juice. This is most often done by replacing 
    the water in the recipe with juice, and possibly a few slices, from 
    a can of pickled beets, but there are other schemes. The color 
    penetrates deeply into the eggs.</li>
  <li><b>Turmeric:</b> &nbsp; The eggs can be dyed a bright yellow by 
    including a teaspoon of Turmeric powder with the spices.</li>
  <li><b>Sugar:</b> &nbsp; Some recipes include sugar, from a couple of 
    teaspoons to absolutely obscene amounts. Use caution here.</li>
  <li><b>Less Vinegar:</b> &nbsp; Less vinegar and more water makes 
    wimpy eggs that have to be kept refrigerated as soon as they've 
    cooled down. They take at least twice as long to be ready to eat.
    </li>
  </ul></li>
