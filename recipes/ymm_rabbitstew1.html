This braised rabbit dish is simple and tasty. Frying the rabbit pieces 
can be done a day or so ahead. It also works just fine using Chicken 
Thighs.

<p>The photo example was made using boneless chicken thigh meat rather 
than bone-in rabbit - far better for a buffet dish, reduces fights at 
the family table, and is much more economical</p>

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut up your <b>RABBIT</b> into serving pieces. Don't waste all that 
    unrecoverable meat on the carcass, use the bony parts to make soup 
    stock. Rabbit makes excellent soup stock.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into cubes about 1 inch on a side. Hold 
    in cold water until needed.</li>
  <li>Dice <b>CELERY</b> small. Pit <b>OLIVES</b> and cut in half. Drain 
    <b>Capers</b>. Mix</li>
  <li>Cap and seed <b>BELL PEPPERS</b> (Red or Green or both). Cut into 
    short strips about 1/2 inch wide.</li>
  <li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> lightly.</li>
  <li>Drain <b>TOMATOES</b>, reserving the juice.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; (1-1/4 hrs)
  <ol start="7">
  <li>In an iron skillet heat <b>Oil</b> to 375&deg;F/190&deg;C and 
    fry <b>Rabbit</b> pieces, turning frequently until lightly browned on 
    all sides. Fry in small batches so the oil stays very hot, that 
    way the outside will brown before the pieces loose too much moisture. 
    Set aside. See <a href="ymm_rabbitstew1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a> for option.</li>
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan heat 1/4 c <b>Olive Oil</b> (Pure 
    or Extra V) over moderate heat and fry <b>Garlic</b> until aromatic, 
    then stir in <b>Tomatoes</b> and fry stirring for about 2 minutes.
    </li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Celery mix</b> and fry stirring often for about 5 
    minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Potatoes</b> and <b>Bell Peppers</b> until well mixed in. 
    Fry, stirring now and then, for about 3 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Rabbit</b> and then <b>Vinegar</b>. Fry over higher 
    heat until vinegar is pretty much evaporated, then stir in 
    <b>Stock</b>,  <b>Tomato Juice</b>, <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. 
    Simmer covered for 30 minutes or until rabbit and potatoes are 
    tender, adding more stock if needed to keep it from drying out.</li>
  <li>Check salt and seasoning. Serve warm.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Rabbit:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for whole frozen rabbits, the way 
  they're sold around here, gutted, skinned and headless. Rabbit is 
  often called "chicken without wings", so chicken thighs are a good 
  (and more economical) substitute. For details see our 
  <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/ingred/ar_rabbitz.html"><b>Rabbits, Jackrabbits &amp; 
  Hares</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; I prefer White Rose potatoes 
  for dishes like this. Reds would also work but avoid Yukon Gold which 
  taste funny and turn to mush if cooked a little long. For details see 
  our <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/ingred/ns_potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Olives:</h3> &nbsp; These should be Mediterranean brine cured 
  olives, not vinegar pickled cocktail or salad olives. See our 
  <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/ingred/olives.html"><b>Olives Page</b></a> for details.
  </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; Frying the meat can be done a day or two ahead 
  and refrigerated to save time on serving day.</li>
