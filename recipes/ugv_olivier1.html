This famous salad is made in endless variations in Russia and elsewhere. 
None of them much resemble the original, served by chef Lucien Olivier

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose are good for this recipe, but Red 
  Potatoes are also fine. "Yukon Gold" type could be used also (though 
  I'm not fond of the flavor) but they should be cooked separately from 
  the carrots to make sure they aren't over cooked and mushy. For details 
  see our <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/ingred/ns_potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Meat:</h3> &nbsp; This may be one or more meats. Most "authentic" 
  for Soviet style is Doctorskaya (Russian style bologna), followed by 
  Veal Tongue and Ham. Boiled or smoked Chicken is also used, but today  
  that version should be called Salade Stolichny (after Ivan Ivanov's 
  salad, which originally contained no chicken). The photo example 
  used Doctorskaya.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Cucumber:</h3> &nbsp; If possible use Persian cucumbers, or some 
  other variety that doesn't require peeling and seeding. If all you 
  have is the standard waxed green blimps, weight is after peeling and 
  seeding.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Pickle:</h3> &nbsp; Russian style Pickles, of course. Originally 
  the salad included only cucumber, but this was often expensive and 
  difficult to get in Soviet Moscow, so it was replaced by pickles. 
  The taste of pickles is now so thoroughly expected in Salat Oliv'ye 
  that I have included some.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Peas:</h3> &nbsp; If you use fresh peas, boil them for for 5 
  minutes in salted water. In Soviet Russia canned peas would be used - 
  in fact, to accurately reproduce Soviet cuisine (or our Eisenhower era 
  "cuisine") is the <u>only</u> legitimate use for canned peas. Any 
  market serving a Russian community will have several imported brands.
  </li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Mayonnaise:</h3> &nbsp; Home made is best, but can be risky, 
  especially in business friendly Red States, due to the raw egg yolks. 
  Second best is Hellmann's Real (east of the Mississippi) or Best Foods 
  Real (west of the Mississippi), as nearly all food writers agree.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Olives:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for pitted olives. These should be 
  Mediterranean oil cured black olives, not the canned California black 
  olives - unless you <u>really</u> want to replicate Soviet cuisine. 
  I use small Kalamata olives which I can buy factory pitted.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>History:</h3> &nbsp; No one can make an "authentic" Olivier Salad. 
  In the 1870s, Olivier served his famous salad at Moscow's Hermitage 
  restaurant. He kept the dressing recipe a tightly held secret which 
  died with him. Ivan Ivanov, a <i>sous chef</i> at the Hermitage made 
  the best attempt to steal the recipe, but his version, Salade 
  Stolichny, was known to be somewhat defective. In any case, the original 
  recipe is known to have included Grouse, Veal tongue, Crayfish, Caviar, 
  Lettuce, Smoked duck and Capers. Veal tongue is still used in higher 
  priced versions, Lettuce is still used by some, and Capers are used as 
  a garnish, but the rest have fallen out of use. The dressing was a kind 
  of mayonnaise, containing French wine vinegar, Proven&ccedil;al olive 
  oil and mustard, but the exact recipe is unknown. 
  <br><h3>Post Olivier</h3> &nbsp; Olivier's family closed the restaurant 
  and moved back to Belgium. Subsequently, the ingredients were 
  progressively cheapened, particularly during the Soviet era. 
  <i>Doktorskaya</i> (Russian Balogna) replaced Grouse, Boiled Eggs 
  replaced Crayfish, Pickles replaced Cucumbers and canned Green Peas 
  replaced Capers and Olives. Even so, this salad remains essential for 
  New Years celebrations among Russians.</li> 
<li id="09">
  <h3>Poland:</h3> The Polish version is very much like the Russian, with 
  the same wide range of variations - except it <u>never</u> contains any 
  kind of meat, fowl or seafood. It's usually called "Cooked Vegetable 
  Salad" or just "Vegetable Salad" - no credits to Russians from these 
  folks.</li>
<li id="10"><b>Russian Salad:</b> &nbsp; This salad is also popular 
  in <b>Iran</b> (with Chicken, often used as a sandwich filler), 
  <b>Turkey</b> (no meat, often used as a sandwich filler), <b>Greece</b> 
  (no meat), <b>Spain</b> (for tapas, canned tuna in place of meat),
  <b>Bulgaria, Serbia</b> (with salami or ham) and <b>Croatia</b> 
  (no meat). I have one Spanish cookbook in which the writer states 
  she has no idea why it's called "Russian Salad".</li>
