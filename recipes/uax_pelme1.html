In Russia, Pelmeni are both made at home and served by specialist 
dumpling restaurants. Siberian Pelmeni are made with a mix of two or 
three meats. In Perm Krai, just west of Siberia, pelmeni made with

    <p>
    In Russia today, many people use a Pelmennitsa (pelmeni mold) to save 
    a lot of time. It is similar to a Ravioli Mold, but honeycomb shaped 
    rather than square. Commercially, Pelmeni are made using complex pasta 
    machines imported from Italy.</p>
    <p>Here we make them the traditional way. Exact time will depend on 
    your dexterity and how fast you work. The photo shows half moon 
    (varenyky), envelope, and flying saucer folds.</p>
    <p>I do all the work on a 2-1/2 foot square sheet of plywood, 
    lightly varnished on the working side. You will also need a 
    <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/ke/ke_rollpin.html"><b>Rolling Pin</b></a>, preferably 
    the French tapered kind, a 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 inch cookie cutter, an 
    18 x 13 inch rimmed baking sheet, and, hopefully a 
    <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/ke/ke_pipebg1.html"><b>Piping Bag</b></a> (pastry bag) 
    with a 1/2 inch plain round nozzle. 
    <br class=cll></p>


  <ol>
  <li>Check that you can get the Baking Sheet into the freezer 
    compartment of your refrigerator and still close the door.</li>
  <li>Beat 1 <b>Egg White</b> moderately so it is uniformly liquid. Pour 
    into a shallow bowl.</li>
  <li>Flour your working board lightly, but completely enough so your 
    dough will not stick.</li>
  <li>Divide your <b>Dough Ball</b> into three equal sized balls. Make 
    sure they aren't sticky or you will have problems. If they are 
    sticky, just knead a powdering of flour into it. Keep one ball out 
    and cover the rest  with thin plastic.</li>
  <li>Roll out one ball very thin, but not quite translucently thin, 
    making sure the sheet can slide on the board. Spread a little more 
    flour under it as needed.</li>
  <li>Cut out about 15 or so 2-1/4 inch circles. Give the cutter a bit 
    of a twist to make sure the cut is complete. Free them by peeling up 
    the dough in between. Keep the off-cuts under plastic if you intend 
    to use them for a 4th ball. Move the circles up front where you can 
    work with them, and cover the rest of the sheet with thin plastic 
    so it won't dry out while you work.</li>
  <li>Use your Piping Bag to squeeze out the right amount of filling 
    onto each circle, a little towards you from exactly centered. Because 
    meat fillings tend to have some stringy stuff in them, you will likely 
    have to use a knife to scrape it off at the nozzle.</li>
  <li>Working with one circle at a time, wet your index finger in the 
    <b>Egg White</b> and wipe it around the edge opposite from you.</li>
  <li>Carefully fold the near edge over the stuffing and stick down to 
    the far edge, making sure all the stuffing is inside. Work the edge 
    from the center out, driving out any air. Now you have a Ukrainian 
    Varenyky. Go on and do all the other circles you have cut.</li>
  <li>Touch one point of each dumpling with <b>Egg White</b>. For 
    envelope fold, wrap the dry point over the stuffing, then wrap the 
    wetted one across to stick to the other one. For flying saucer 
    form, bring the points together along the straight side, allowing 
    the curved edge to curl up around the stuffing (see 
    <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/recipes/uax_pelme1x.html#forms"><b>Photo</b></a>). The flying 
    saucer form is fancier and cooks more evenly, but doesn't take much 
    more time or skill than the envelope form, but it does take more room 
    on the freezing sheet and in the the bag. Another way is to put 
    pleats in it as you seal the main edge and leave it at that, but 
    that form looks like it takes a lot of practice.</li>
  <li>Lightly flour your Baking Sheet and place the finished Pelmeni on it 
    as close together as you can without them touching (a little touching 
    of the edges is not a problem). Cover with thin plastic while you 
    work on more.</li>
  <li>Keep at it until you have completely filled the baking sheet, or 
    run out of something.</li>
  <li>Slide the Baking Sheet into the freezer compartment of your 
    refrigerator and let the Pelmeni freeze. Traditionally, Pelmeni 
    are rarely cooked before they have been frozen.</li>
  <li>Pry the Pelmeni off the baking sheet and bag them in a plastic 
    bag. They can be kept frozen for months.</li>

  <h2>Serving Pelmeni</h2>
  
  <p>Pelmeni are served various way, but most commonly tumbled with 
  Butter. They can also be fried lightly brown in butter - not 
  traditional but often done today. I particularly recommend this for 
  vegetarian versions which need a little bump in flavor.</p>
  <p> Condiments on the side may include Vinegar, Sour Cream, a 
  mix of Sour Cream and Vinegar, and Lemon Juice. In the Russians 
  Far East, Soy Sauce is often provided, and also in Australia since 
  most Russians there came through China or the Far East.</p>
  <p>See <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/recipes/uax_pelme1x.html"><b>Photo</b></a> for one of 
  my favorite servings - but it's not quite 100% authentic. The Pelmeni 
  are very lightly fried in butter, then served over a bed of Frozen Peas 
  and Onions, also lightly fried in Butter. It is all garnished with 
  chopped Dill and Parsley. Although some Russians may have served 
  Pelmeni with peas (I don't know for sure), and all the rest of the 
  ingredients are authentic enough - in Russia it would be <u>Canned</u> 
  <u>Peas</u> - just like here during the Eisenhower Administration.
  </p>
  <p>Lemon Juice goes very well with this serving, but provide lemon 
  as wedges. If you mix lemon juice into the peas they will soon become  
  the same Army olive drab color as real Soviet canned peas (although 
  they will still taste better).</p>
  <p>Serving Pelmeni with peas is not only delicious, it's a very good 
  idea for buffet service. Mixing them into a pile of peas discourages 
  a few greedy people from just scooping up all the Pelmeni and leaving 
  none for others.</p>
    <p><br></p>

<br>

<h2 id="fillings">Fillings</h2>

<p>The amount of fillings here will be sufficient for the amount of 
dough given above, divided into three balls, plus a 4th ball formed from 
the leftovers from cutting the circles. Actually, my freezer compartment 
is so jammed it can hold only one baking sheet with about 120 pelmeni 
made from three balls, so I form the left over filling into patties and 
fry them.</p>

  <h3>Meat Filling</h3>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (30 min, grinding your own meats)
    <br>Note that the meats should be a little fatty, and they should 
    be ground or chopped fine, but not to mush. Persons who have tried to 
    replace pork with other meats report inferior pelmeni, though lamb 
    probably works much better than turkey, and is sometimes used. 
  <ol>
  <li>Grind or chop fairly fine, <b>BEEF</b> and <b>PORK</b>, if not 
    purchased ground. Note: meat should be very cold before sending 
    through the grinder or chopping.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> very fine. Some recipes call for 
    pur&eacute;eing them, but I find pur&eacute;ed onions rather bitter,

  <h3>Perm Filling - Vegetarian</h3>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; 
    (50 minutes + cooking time for Turnip)
    <br>Perm, administrative center of the Krai of Perm, is just outside 
    the western edge of Siberia. While meat Pelmeni are certainly eaten 
    in Perm, vegetable fillings are also popular there. All I've been 
    able to find is that Turnips and Mushrooms are used, no other 
    details, so I've used both in this recipe. The amounts given here 
    will make about 140 pelmeni.
  <ol>
  <li>Peel <b>TURNIP</b>. Place in a pot of water and bring to a boil. 
    Simmer until cooked through, and a sharp skewer passes through 
    without hitting a stiff spot. Drain and cool.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>Turnip</b> fine or mash.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>MUSHROOMS</b> quite small and evenly so they won't be 
    clogging the piping bag nozzle. I use a 
    <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/ke/kn_mezzaz.html"><b>Mezzaluna</b></a> for the chopping 
    as it will not scatter pieces all over as chopping with a regular 
    knife will.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> very fine.</li>
  <li>In a skillet, heat <b>Oil</b> and fry <b>Onion</b> just until 
    translucent, but no browning. Then stir in <b>Mushrooms</b> and fry 
    over moderate heat, stirring now and then, until they have softened 
    and given up nearly all their water - you don't want any free water 
    in the final mix. Let cool.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>all Items</b>.</li> 
  </ol>
  <h3 id="02">Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; Regular white mushrooms 
    will work here, but I prefer at least half the small king trumpets 
    now easily available here in Southern California. Also, a couple of 
    fresh Shiitakes would help intensify the flavor. In Russia, dried 
    mushrooms, usually Porcini, are often used, but those are not so 
    commonly available in North America, and take a few hours of soaking 
    and an hour simmering to prepare them.<p></p>
  <h3 id="03">Serving:</h3> &nbsp; After cooking these in 
    boiling water, I recommend frying them lightly browned in butter, 
    as they could use a little flavor boost to compete with meat pelmeni.
    <p></p>
