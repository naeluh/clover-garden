Perhaps Lebanon's most famous dish, this salad is also 
enjoyed in surrounding countries. While proportions vary somewhat, an 
authentic tabouleh is made with a modest amount of wheat and an 
immodest amount of parsley.

<ol>
  <li>Soak <b>BULGUR</b> in warm water to cover for about 45  minutes 
    (add more water as needed to keep covered. Drain through a very fine 
    strainer, bag and refrigerate.</li>
  <li>Strip leaves from <b>PARSLEY</b> stems and chop fine. Do the same 
    with <b>MINT</b>, mix, bag and refrigerate. Note: Chop with a very sharp 
    knife, or, preferably, a mezzaluna, to avoid  bruising the herbs - you 
    want them to look good.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>TOMATOES</b>, chop fine and refrigerate.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>SCALLIONS</b> fine, using white and light green parts.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Scallions</b>, <b>Pepper</b> and <b>Bulgur</b>. Refrigerate.</li>
  <li>Squeeze <b>LEMON JUICE</b> and mix with <b>Olive Oil</b> and 
    <b>Salt</b>. Refrigerate.</li>
  <li>When ready to serve, mix everything together well, then adjust lemon 
    juice and salt to taste.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Bulgur:</h3> &nbsp; #1 or #2 can be used. Do not 
  attempt to use cracked wheat - bulgur is precooked and soft, cracked 
  wheat is raw and hard.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Parsley:</h3> &nbsp; The amount given is for chopped 
  fine and moderately packed in the measuring cup. Use only flat leaf 
  (Italian) parsley, curly leaf tastes like plastic. 1 pound of not too 
  stemmy parsley will yield 8 ounces (50%) which will measure about 
  3 cups chopped.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Make Ahead:</h3> &nbsp; The procedure given here presumes you want 
  to make it ahead as much as possible. Using this sequence and keeping 
  everything refrigerated you can make it up to 6 hours ahead. About 3/4 
  hour is devoted to the tedious job of stripping Parsley leaves from 
  stems. In the Levant this would be assigned to children eager to help, 
  but you'rs would probably call Child Services if you tried to drag 
  them from their texting and video games.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; This salad is traditionally served with 
  Romaine Lettuce leaves on the side. Some salad is spooned onto a piece 
  of leaf, the leaf is rolled around it, and eaten.</li>
