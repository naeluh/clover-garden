This delicious recipe will surely get comments, because cuttlefish 
dishes are not often seen in North America. They are, however, popular 
in North Africa and Mediterranean Europe.

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 hrs - 40 min work)
  <ol>
  <li>Clean and pull apart <b>Cuttlefish</b> as needed (for details see 
    <a href="mmf_cuttl1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a> and our 
    <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/ingred/seacuttl.html"><b>Cuttlefish</b></a> page). Cut 
    into pieces as desired - about 1 inch random squares is good. For 
    large Indo-Pacific Cuttlefish, use also the fins, and the small parts 
    that feel "plasticy" raw will be fine too.</li>
  <li>Bring a pot of water to a boil, stir in <b>Cuttlefish</b>, bring 
    back to a boil and simmer 5 minutes. Drain.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONION</b> lengthwise and slice thin crosswise. Crush 
    <b>GARLIC</b> and chop medium. Mix.</li>
  <li>In a spacious saut&eacute; pan, heat <b>Olive Oil</b>. Stir in 
    <b>Onion mix</b> and <b>Cuttlefish</b>. Fry over moderate heat, 
    stirring until onions are lightly browned.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Paprika</b> and <b>Turmeric</b>, then immediately take 
    off the heat.</li>
  <li>Sir in <b>Tomato Sauce</b>, <b>Salt</b>, <b>Pepper</b> and 1-1/2 
    c <b>Water</b>. Bring to a boil, cover tightly and simmer over low 
    heat for about 30 minutes or until cuttlefish is tender.</li>
  <li><u>Meanwhile</u>: &nbsp; Blast the <b>CHILI</b> black with your 
    <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/ke/ke_torchz.html"><b>Propane Torch</b></a>. Brush 
    off the skin under running water.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>Chili</b> into slices about 1/4 inch wide by 3/4 inch long. 
    Grind <b>Cumin</b> fine. Chop <b>PARSLEY</b> small. Mix all together 
    with <b>Frozen Peas</b>.</li>
  <li>When <b>Cuttlefish</b> is tender, and you are nearly ready to 
    serve, stir in <b>Finish mix</b> and simmer 4 minutes longer. Stir 
    in a little boiling water if needed to loosen the sauce. You don't 
    want to do this ahead as the peas will lose their bright green 
    color, but the taste will still be fine on reheating.</li> 
  <li>Serve hot with Flat Bread or Couscous (authentic) or Rice (not 
    authentic, but it works fine). See also 
    <a href="mmf_cuttl1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a> for buffet service.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Cuttlefish:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for whole, 
  cleaned, boned and skinned Indo-Pacific cuttlefish. These can be found 
  all ready to cut up and cook in the freezer cases of the large Asian 
  markets here in Los Angeles.  1-1/2 pounds will yield 1 pound of body 
  meat. The pattern recipe says to use only the bodies, but here in 
  California, we've already violated authenticity by using meaty 
  Indo-Pacific Cuttlefish rather than unavailable European Cuttlefish, 
  so go ahead and toss in the head meat and tentacles if you like - a 
  little more cuttlefish won't hurt this recipe at all. For details see 
  our <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/ingred/seacuttl.html"><b>Cuttlefish</b></a> 
  page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Tomato Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; Use a very simple tomato 
  sauce without strong seasonings. I use Faraon brand "Spanish style" 
  which comes in convenient 8 ounce cans, but other simple sauces will 
  work.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Chili Anaheim:</h3> &nbsp; This is the "long green" 
  chili sold here in Southern California. It may be called "New Mexico" 
  or just "Long Green" in other regions. It is a rather mild chili. For 
  details see our <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html"><b>Chilis</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Service:</h3> &nbsp; This recipe is written up 
  for table service. For buffet service, I'd make two or three recipes, 
  keeping the pieces of cuttlefish no larger than 1 inch, and toss in 
  Tomatoes (skinned and diced 1/2 inch) and/or cooked 3/4 inch Potato 
  Cubes (white rose are good). About 12 ounces of each per recipe will 
  do. With potatoes you'll also want more sauce, so make about 1-1/3 
  times what is called for above. The pattern recipe suggests these 
  additions, so I presume they're sufficiently authentic.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe is a 
  bit confused. It clearly calls for "Cuttlefish", yet in the steps it 
  describes "cuttlefish pouches", but cuttlefish doesn't come in pouches. 
  What's in the step photos looks like squid, but the photo of the 
  finished dish (a fancy restaurant serving) shows very thick pieces 
  that are surely Cuttlefish.</li>
