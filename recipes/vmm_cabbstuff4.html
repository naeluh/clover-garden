for method.
<ol>
<li>Core <b>CABBAGES</b>. It is very important to remove the core 
  completely so boiling water can get at the stem ends of the leaves, 
  and for ease of stripping off the leaves.</li>
<li>Bring plenty of water to a boil in a pot tall enough to completely 
  submerge a Cabbage. Lower one of the <b>Cabbages</b> in (Carefully - 
  see <a href="vmm_cabbstuff4.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a>) and hold it down with a wooden 
  spoon in the core hole for about 5 minutes. Swish it around a bit, 
  and when the outer two leaves start to drift away, it's ready. With 
  the burner still on high, hold the Cabbage steady with the 
  wooden spoon. Take tongs and start peeling away the outermost leaves. 
  Hold each by the stem, gently shaking it loose and lifting it out. 
  Peel until the leaves are getting too small to stuff. Lift out the 
  remaining cabbage and set it aside. Now do the other Cabbage. Keep 
  small and torn leaves and some of the water for cooking.</li>
<li>Place each softened cabbage leaf outside up on your cutting board and 
  shave the thick central rib thinner to make the leaf more flexible (see 
  <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/recipes/vmm_cabbstuff4x.html#gal"><b>Photo Gallery</b></a>).</li>
<li>Grind <b>BEEF</b>, if not purchased ground. It should be ground 
  quite fine, perhaps two or three times in a home meat grinder.</li>
<li>Pour <b>MILK</b> over bread and mix in <b>Spices</b>. Mix until 
  smooth (I run the bread with half the milk in a min-prep processor). 
  Massage into <b>BEEF</b> until very evenly distributed.</li>
<li>Place each leaf inside up, and place a gob of stuffing (be generous, 
  this isn't hors d'oeuvres) near the stem end. Give it one turn, Fold 
  the sides in and roll up. Keep chilled until ready to cook.</li>
<li>Make the <b>SAUCE</b>: &nbsp; (you can do this while the rolls are 
  cooking). Bring <b>Stock</b> to a simmer. In a bowl, mix cold 
  <b>Water</b> and <b>Flour</b> until evenly mixed. Whip in simmering 
  stock, a little at a time until the mix is nice and smooth, and too 
  loose to form lumps. Whip it into the Stock until evenly distributed. 
  Simmer for about 7 minutes, then stir in all the remaining 
  <b>Sauce items</b>.</li>
<li>Line the bottom of your chosen cooking vessel with the small or 
  torn cabbage leaves. Proceed appropriately as described in 
  <a href="vmm_cabbstuff4.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>, placing the <b>Cabbage Rolls</b> 
  flap side down.</li>
<li>With Tongs, move the <b>Cabbage Rolls</b> to your serving dish and 
  pour the <b>Sauce</b> over. Serve hot with boiled Potatoes.</li>
<li>This dish reheats well.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Cabbage:</h3> &nbsp; Most recipes call for one 
  large cabbage but I prefer two medium (about 2-1/2 pounds each) which 
  will be safer to handle, and the leaves are more even in size. Two 
  2-1/2 pound cabbages will yield about 20 to 24 leaves of suitable size.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; I prefer a nice strong beef 
  stock (which I usually have on hand). The pattern sauce recipe used 
  some broth from a casserole, some potato cooking water and a bouillon 
  cube (see <a href="vmm_cabbstuff4.html#05">Note-5</a>).</li> 
<li id="03">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; There are several ways you can 
  cook the rolls. 
  <ul>
  <li><b>Boiling:</b> &nbsp; This method was used by the pattern 
    recipe. Tie the rolls up with string and boil 15 to 20 minutes in 
    the cabbage water. Cut off strings and arrange in a serving dish. 
    This seems a little tedious to me.</li>
  <li><b>Dutch Oven:</b> &nbsp; This is the traditional method. 
    Preheat oven to 325&deg;F/165&deg;C. Arrange the Cabbage Rolls as 
    noted in the instructions, placing them in several layers. Add about 
    1 cup of the cabbage cooking liquid. When the oven is ready, cover 
    the Dutch oven tightly and bring to a simmer on the stove top. Place 
    in the hot oven and bake for about 3/4 hour.</li>
  <li><b>Saut&eacute; Pan</b> &nbsp; Arrange the rolls in a spacious 
    saut&eacute; pan, preferably in a single layer. Add about 1-1/2 
    cup of the cabbage cooking liquid. Bring to a simmer, cover tightly 
    and simmer about 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
  <li><b>Electric Skillet</b> &nbsp; This is the method I use for 
    parties, because it keeps the stove free. Arrange rolls in an 
    electric skillet, preferably in a single layer, and put in 1-1/2 to 
    2 cups of cabbage cooking liquid. Cover tightly and set to just 
    keep the water boiling. Cook for 20 to 25 minutes, a little less if 
    you'll be reheating the rolls before serving. When done I cut them 
    in half crosswise (easier to handle on a party plate) and carefully 
    stack them in a smaller electric skillet set to "keep warm". I then 
    pour the sauce over. If they are cold and being reheated in the small 
    skillet, be sure there's about 1/3 cup water in the bottom, and pour 
    the sauce over after they are warm.</li>
    </ul>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Danger!</h3> &nbsp; You've got a big pot of boiling water and 
  you're dealing with a big, heavy, misbehaving lump of cabbage. Most 
  methods ask you to remove the cabbage to peel the leaves. This is 
  dangerous as the cabbage is very heavy coming out, and any slip 
  results in a tsunami of scalding hot water. My method, described 
  in the instructions, is far safer, as the cabbage is tiny by time it 
  is taken out. It is also quicker and produces the best quality, 
  evenly cooked leaves. I use a strong skimmer purchased from a 
  restaurant supply (see <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/recipes/vmm_cabbstuff4x.html#gal">
  <b>Photo Gallery</b></a>) to lower the Cabbage in and lift it out, 
  steadied with a wooden spoon in the core hole.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe called for peeling 
  leaves off a raw cabbage, which is tedious and results in a lot of 
  torn leaves. The alternate was par boiling a whole cabbage, core in, 
  and pulling it out several times to separate the leaves, which is 
  dangerous, slow, and yields a lot of unevenly cooked leaves. She 
  served with a plain white sauce or browned butter. I chose instead 
  the sauce she gave for the next recipe in her book, the same beef 
  and cabbage cooked as a layered casserole.</li>
