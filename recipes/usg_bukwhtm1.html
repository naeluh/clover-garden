Californian practice, as we don't often have hot ashes in our kitchens.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Buckwheat:</h3>  &nbsp; Roasted buckwheat is the 
  most available form here in Southern California, and will do fine. 
  Select a brand that is roasted to a rather light color.  Some Russians 
  prefer to roast their own. Unroasted is harder to find, but Asian 
  markets here, particularly Korean markets, often have it. Using 
  unroasted, you must roast it yourself or it will likely become mushy 
  when cooked. For details see our 
  <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/ingred/cn_buckz.html"><b>Buckwheat</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Mushrooms:</h3> &nbsp; Any fresh mushrooms can be used. I usually 
  use the small King Trumpet mushrooms now commonly available here in 
  Southern California (Hokto brand in 9.5 ounce packages), because I 
  like the flavor, and because they keep so long in the fridge. If you 
  use fresh Shiitakes, give them a 20 minute soak in hot water. It 
  completely changes their texture.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Broth:</h3> &nbsp; Russians usually use beef broth, except during 
  Lent. A vegetable broth will work fine, though, even if it isn't Lent. 
  For details see our <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/recipes/giv_stockv1.html">
  <b>Vegetable Stock</b></a> recipe.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Oil:</h3></a> &nbsp; In Russia and other Eastern Orthodox regions, 
  Sunflower Oil would be used. During Lent, the church listed cooking 
  oils as banned, but this new oil from North America was not on the 
  list, so became very popular. I rarely have Sunflower Oil because it 
  goes rancid so rapidly, so I use Pure Olive Oil (not virgin). For 
  details see our <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/ingred/oi_cookz.html">
  <b>Cooking Oils</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Butter:</h3> &nbsp; The Eastern Orthodox church forbids all dairy 
  products during Lent (6 weeks for the Great Lent) and that's gotta 
  hurt, since Buckwheat Kasha is usually served with plenty of butter. 
  This recipe, however, can get along without it - maybe just a touch 
  more generous with the Sunflower Seed Oil. Otherwise, use as much 
  butter as your concept of "diet" allows.</li>
<li id="06"><b>Variations</b></a>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Dried Mushrooms:</b> &nbsp; One ounce of dried mushrooms is 
    often added. In Russia this would generally be Boletus (Porcini). 
    These should be soaked for hours or overnight and simmered for an 
    hour to make them edible. Other dried mushrooms could be used.</li>
