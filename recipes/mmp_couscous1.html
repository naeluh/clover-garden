In Morocco, a last dish to make sure you are stuffed, but we infidels 
can use it however we please.  I like this formal method for the 
flexibility provided by the hold time allowed, but modify it a bit - 
see <a href="mmp_couscous1.html#04">Note-4</a>.

  <ol>
  <li>Wash <b>COUSCOUS</b> in a large shallow pan with 3 times as much 
    <b>Water</b>. Stir briefly with your hands, then strain out excess 
    water. Quickly, so the grains are still wet spread them in a rimmed 
    baking sheet or similar appliance and let them swell for 10 minutes.
    </li>
  <li>Work <b>Couscous</b> with your fingers to break up all lumps which 
    may have formed and let rest at least another 10 minutes.</li>
  <li>Set up your steamer as described in <a href="mmp_couscous1.html#03"><b>Note-3</b></a>. 
    Bring <b>Stew</b> or <b>Broth</b> to a boil in the bottom pot. Place 
    the steamer pan on top, seal as necessary and pour in 1/4 of the 
    <b>Couscous</b>. Steam uncovered for 5 minutes, then gently add the 
    rest of the <b>Couscous</b>. Lower the heat to moderate and steam 
    for 20 minutes, uncovered.</li>
  <li>Dump the <b>Couscous</b> into a shallow pan and spread with a 
    wooden spatula or spoon. Mix 1 t <b>Salt</b> into about 3/4 cup of 
    <b>Water</b> (for our 2 cups of couscous). Sprinkle this evenly over 
    the couscous.</li>
  <li>As soon as Couscous is cool enough to handle, coat your hands with 
    <b>Olive Oil</b> and work the grains again to break up any lumps. The 
    oil on your hands very lightly oils the couscous to help keep the 
    grains separate. Sprinkle a little more water if it feels too dry. 
    Let rest for at least another 10 minutes. At this point the couscous 
    can be covered with a damp cloth and held for several hours.</li>
  <li>Return the <b>Couscous</b> to the steamer pan and steam for an 
    additional 20 minutes. <br><b>IF</b> your stew is done and can't stand 
    another 20 minutes, steam over water, otherwise steam over the stew.</li>
  <li>Mound onto a serving plate, work a deep depression into the top of 
    the mound and ladle in some of the stew.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Couscous:</h3> &nbsp; North African couscous is 
  composed of very tiny rough grains. The large and small bead couscous 
  are Middle Eastern (Lebanese). Beware of "instant" couscous or other 
  names or precooked - they won't work with this method. For details see 
  our <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/ingred/pa_cousz.html"><b>Couscous</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Stew:</h3> &nbsp; Properly this is a Tagine, an 
  aromatic stew which will be served before or with the couscous. Steam 
  from the cooking stew infuses the couscous with its flavor. An aromatic 
  broth can be used if you aren't preparing stew.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Steamer:</h3> &nbsp; You need a steamer of sufficient 
  size to contain the stew below and the couscous in the steamer pan which 
  must not touch the stew. The top pan must seal tightly to the bottom. In 
  Morocco a strip of cheese cloth or similar is wet, dusted with flour and 
  wrapped around the rim of the lower pot to seal so all steam must go up 
  through the steamer pan. If your steamer pan has holes too large to hold 
  the couscous line it with a single layer of muslin. The traditional 
  <i>kiskas</i> (<i>couscousiere</i>) consists of a deep lower pot and a 
  medium deep steamer pan.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; I have successfully used a 28 cm Chinese 
  steamer, a much lower and wider device than the <i>kiskas</i>. The 
  pot is thin stainless which risks burning the stew in spots so I put 
  a comal (flat steel plate for roasting tortillas) between the pot and 
  the flame to spread the heat.
  <br>While this setup works with the formal Paula Wolfert method, I am 
  actually more likely to do my stew separately in a large saut&eacute; 
  pan, and steam the couscous over broth or water with some aromatic 
  vegetable trimmings, spices and slices of ginger in it. This allows 
  a more vigorous boil, so a messy fabric and flour seal between pot 
  and pan isn't as important, and timing factors are easier to control.
  </li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Other Methods</h3> &nbsp; Some recipes skip the second spreading 
  and second steaming, calling for the couscous to be steamed covered 20 
  minutes over the stew and then served. This may result in couscous that 
  is less fluffy. Some recipes call for oiling the couscous before the 
  first steaming but PW says this produces a less 
  tender couscous.</li>
