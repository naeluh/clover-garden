Clam Chowder is perhaps the most famous of all New England recipes, and  
this recipe has actual clams in it! I liven it up with some 
<a href="3of_clamchdne1.html#06"><b>California Touches</b></a> which have been 
declared excellent at parties.

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Clams:</h3> &nbsp; Officially you should use live 
  New England <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_bvhardz.html"><b>Hard Clams</b></a> 
  but here in Southern California the only live clams widely available 
  are the tiny Manilla clams (Japanese littleneck) and usually some 
  Mexican farmed cherrystone size hard clams. Either variety is 
  unacceptably costly for soup. On the other hand, we have a wide variety 
  of frozen clam meat in the Asian markets, and canned clams are widely 
  available. Canned is easiest, but frozen is better. Prepare each as 
  follows.
  <ul>
  <li><b>Live Clams:</b> &nbsp; Scrub clam shells thoroughly, 
    discarding any that are not tightly closed. Put in a pot with about 
    1-1/2 inches of water on the bottom. Bring to a boil and steam just 
    until the clams open. Open the clams completely catching any liquid 
    in them and adding it to the pot. Remove the meat and chop to the 
    size desired, discarding the shells. Strain the liquid to remove any 
    grit it may contain. You should end up with just about the same 
    amount of juice as the amount of water you started with.</li>
  <li><b>Canned Clams:</b> &nbsp; Recipes always say to use "chopped 
    clams", but around here we mostly just have "baby clams", which are 
    actually just the right size for chowder right out of the can. Drain 
    the clams keeping all the liquid.</li>
  <li><b>Frozen Clams:</b> &nbsp; Those found in Asian markets are of 
    very high quality, but unfortunately you don't get a lot of clam 
    broth with them. Do keep the melt water from when you thaw them. 
    You will have to make up for this with more clam juice, or some fish 
    or shellfish stock. A famous recipe for Rhode Island clam chowder 
    includes chicken broth 3 to 1 with clam juice, so that's acceptable 
    too. Frozen clams are almost always large enough to require chopping 
    to the desired size.</li>
  </ul>
  Combine recovered juice with the bottled Clam Juice. In all cases you 
  should end up with nearly 1 quart of juice.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; In New England, russet 
  potatoes are used, and these are fine for a soup served immediately. 
  For a more durable chowder, like for a party, White Rose work well. 
  Avoid the Yukon Gold types because they turn to mush if cooked just 
  a little long. For details see our 
  <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/ingred/ns_potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Salt Pork:</h3>  This is historically correct, 
  and I use it. Today bacon is often used instead, with some change 
  in flavor.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Clam Juice:</h3> &nbsp; Snow's seems to have a 
  near monopoly on this stuff around here, though I have found a few 
  stores with Crown Prince, which I think is a little better. Bottled 
  clam juice is a lot more watery but less salty than the juice from 
  canned clams or from freshly steamed clams.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Flour:</h3> &nbsp; Most New England clam chowder 
  recipes call for thickening with flour. This is, in my opinion, 
  superfluous and degrades flavor so I don't use it - just crush a few 
  pieces of potato for thickening. Commercial clam chowder is generally 
  heavily thickened to cover the lack of clams in it.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>California Touches:</h3> 
  <ul>
  <li><b>Chili:</b> &nbsp; In Southern California it is unthinkable that 
    a soup doesn't have at least a touch of chili, so I include a split 
    Serrano Chili. This can be removed during cooking if you think the 
    soup is getting more chili heat than you want.</li>
  <li><b>Celery:</b> &nbsp; I use Chinese Celery, which has thin stems 
    and more flavor than Pascal Celery, and a whole lot of leaves, which 
    I include.</li>
  <li><b>Thai Fish Sauce:</b> &nbsp; I add 1-1/2 Tablespoons, which 
    definitely enriches the soup's sea flavors. If you are unfamiliar 
    with this wonderful potion, see our 
    <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html"><b>Fish Sauce - 
    Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
