An excellent light but very flavorful stew, inexpensive and easy to make 
in advance. In Ireland it is more a city dish than a country dish.  For method see

<p>The name "Coddle" means cooked very gently, which it has to be if you 
use Russet potatoes as they do in Ireland (see <a href="bmm_dubcod1.html#03">
<b>Note-3</b></a>).</p>

  <b><u>Prep</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>BACON</b>, if rashers, to half width and about 2 inches long. 
    If ends and pieces, about 1/8 inch thick by whatever works.</li>
  <li>Quarter <b>ONIONS</b> lengthwise and slice medium crosswise.
  <li>Peel <b>CARROTS</b>. Cut into lengths of 1 to 1-1/2 inches.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into largish chunks, 1 to 1-1/2 inches 
    on a side. Hold in cold water until needed.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>PARSLEY</b> small.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp;  (1-3/4+ hr, depending)
  <ol start="6">
  <li>put about 1/16th inch of Water in a heavy skillet and stir in 
    <b>Bacon</b>. Fry stirring over moderate heat until water has 
    evaporated and until the first hint of becoming crisp. Drain bacon 
    well, holding the fat aside.</li>
  <li>With about 1 Tablespoon of the bacon fat in the skillet, fry the 
    onions, stirring until they are translucent. Remove from the 
    skillet.</li>
  <li>Pierce <b>Sausages</b> all over with a fork (if you know they 
    will exude fat, some sausages exude none). Place them in the skillet 
    with about 1/4 inch of Water. Bring to a boil and hold at a light 
    boil, tumbling the sausages now and then until the water has 
    evaporated and the Sausages start to fry. If needed, add some of the 
    bacon fat. Fry until lightly browned all over. Remove from the pan, 
    cut them into lengths between 1 and 1-1/2 inches or as desired 
    (some recipes leave them whole, but that would be disastrous for 
    buffet service).</li>
 <li>Drain <b>Potatoes</b>. Place <b>All Ingredients</b> in a suitable 
    stew pot (for stovetop) or in a heavy Dutch oven (for oven). Bring 
    to a boil and cover tightly. Simmer very slowly until potatoes are 
    quite tender (20 to 30 minutes on stovetop) or in the oven 
    (see <a href="bmm_dubcod1.html#06"><b>Note-6</b></a>).</li>
  <li>Serve with Irish soda bread and Guinness. This dish reheats very 
    well, if you use the right potatoes.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Bacon:</h3> &nbsp; This can be thick rashers, chunks, or ends 
  and pieces of best quality smoked bacon.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Sausage:</h3> &nbsp; This should be a best 
  quality pure pork sausage with a thin natural casing. Preferably it 
  should be store made for quality. Since most English / Irish sausages 
  available here contain bread, I used fresh bratwurst from a local 
  sausage maker. For details see our 
  <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/ingred/sausage.html"><b>Sausages</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; The Irish will eat only 
  russet potatoes - even during the blight they wouldn't plant any other 
  kind. I, however, am not Irish, and I want a potato that's a little 
  more durable for buffet service and reheating, so I use White Rose, 
  an "all purpose" potato. Avoid Yukon Gold type potatoes because they 
  disintegrate into mush if cooked just a little long or reheated, and 
  they aren't in any way Irish. For details see our 
  <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/ingred/ns_potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Carrots:</h3> &nbsp; Many recipes do not include carrots, 
  but of those, some of their accompanying photos show carrots. Photos 
  that don't match the recipe seem to be a British / Indian tradition. 
  Anyway, I feel they improve the flavor.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> Most recipes call for ham stock, but 
  most realize ham stock is unlikely to be available and allow beef or 
  chicken stock. A good number of recipes on the Internet allow bouillon 
  cubes (apparently "stock cubes" in Irish).</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; Most recipes call for 
  layering the prepared ingredients in a casserole with the Potatoes on 
  top, then bringing to a boil on the stove top. Next cover tightly 
  and cook in the oven at 325&deg;F/165&deg;C for about 3 hours (I 
  haven't tried it this way). Of course, the Irish didn't have stoves 
  with ovens until very recently, so this would have been cooked in a 
  Bastable Oven (see <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/recipes/bmm_dubcod1x.html#gal"><b>Photo 
  Gallery</b></a>) set in hot hearth embers, with more hot embers poured 
  on top. Here in Sunny Southern California we don't have hearth embers, 
  and we don't fire up an oven unless we really need to, so I cook this 
  entirely on the stove top at a very low simmer. Doing the pot cooking 
  in a slow cooker would also work very well, but would take a lot 
  longer. A good compromise is to bring it to a boil on the stovetop, 
  then pour into the slow cooker it will be served from to finish.</li>
