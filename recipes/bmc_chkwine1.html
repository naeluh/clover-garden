This English dish was around during the time of Elizabeth I. In those 
times sugar was very expensive, so dishes were sweetened with dried 
fruit. This dish is rather sweet, the way they liked them then, but 
it's tasty.

<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>CHICKEN</b> into largish chunks, about 1-1/2 inch or so.
    Too small, they will thicken the sauce too much.</li>
  <li>Cut <b>PRUNES</b> in half crosswise. Pit <b>DATES</b> and cut in 
    half lengthwise. Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin and chop fine. Core 
    <b>APPLE</b> and cut into 8 wedges. Cut the wedges in half crosswise. 
    Grind <b>Cinnamon</b> and <b>Nutmeg</b>. Mix all with 
    <b>Currents</b>.</li>
  </ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/4 hr, depending)
  <ol start="8">
  <li>Rub <b>Chicken</b> with <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. Dust 
    lightly with <b>Flour</b>, shaking off all excess.</li>
  <li>In a iron pan, heat <b>Oil</b> about 1/8 inch deep or a little 
    more. Fry <b>Chicken</b> in batches until lightly browned on all 
    sides. Batches won't take much longer, and the chicken will brown 
    before it dries out. Drain on paper towels.</li>
  <li>In a tightly coverable pan, place <b>Chicken</b>, <b>White Wine</b> 
    and the <b>Flavorings mix</b>.  Bring to a boil, cover tightly and 
    simmer slowly until Chicken is tender (about 30 minutes).</li>
  <li>The flour on the Chicken will absorb a lot of liquid, and there 
    should be a little left to make the sauce. If needed, correct with 
    boiling water.</li>
  <li>Serve Chicken hot with the Sauce.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Use Thigh and Leg meat, which is now widely 
  available skinned and boned. This weight is for skinless, boneless 
  and trimmed of fat. The pattern recipe used bone-in joints (you would 
  need about 4 pounds), but I use just meat for ease of buffet service, 
  which also prevents family fights over parts.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Oil:</h3> &nbsp; Use a durable, high temperature oil. Pure or 
  Pomace Olive Oil (not Virgin) is good, but Peanut or Rice Bran oils 
  will work. For details see our <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/ingred/oi_cookz.html">
  <b>Cooking Oils</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>White Wine:</h3> &nbsp; This should be a dry wine, as there is 
  much else sweet in this recipe.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Dates:</h3> &nbsp; Diglets are fine. The super 
  sweet Madjools were not available in England. They were available only 
  to Arab royalty until some had to be sent to California to save them 
  from disease. We sell them to anyone who has cash.</li>
