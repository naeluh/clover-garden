It isn't Guly&aacute;s, and may not be from the Sz&eacute;kely (a 
Hungarian tribe in Transylvania) - see <a href="omm_pigkrauth1.html#07"><b>Note-7</b></a>. 
It is, however, delicious and endlessly popular.

<p>Technically this is a P&ouml;rk&ouml;lt, which has much less liquid 
than a Guly&aacute;s.  If I'm serving this buffet style, I make it just 
a little more liquid and stir the potatoes in before serving.</p>

<b><u>Prep:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
<ol>
<li>Trim the <b>PORK</b> of excess fat and cut into 1 inch cubes.</li>
<li>Slice <b>ONIONS</b> thin and chop fine.</li>
<li>Char <b>PEPPERS</b> with your propane torch and brush the skin off 
  under cold running water (prevents annoying curls of skin in the stew). 
  Cut into strips about 1/2 inch by 1 inch.</li>
<li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into about 1 inch chunks. Keep in cold 
  water until needed.</li>
<li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b> lightly. Crush <b>Caraway Seeds</b> moderately. 
  Mix all <b>Seasoning items</b>.</li>
<li>Drain <b>SAUERKRAUT</b> and squeeze out remaining juice. Reserve some 
  of the juice in case you want the stew a bit more tart when finished.
  Spread it out on the cutting board and make cuts through it about 2 
  inches apart, then the same at right angles. This will keep it from 
  tangling up into a big lump in the stew.</li>
</ol>
<b><u>Run:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2-3/4 hrs)
<ol start="7">
<li>In a well seasoned iron skillet, heat <b>Lard</b>. Bring it up very 
  hot, but not to smoking. Fry <b>Pork</b> in batches until lightly 
  browned on all sides. Place each batch in a heavy bottomed stew pot 
  as it is finished.</li>
<li>Fry <b>Onions</b> until translucent (add more lard if needed). Pour 
  all into the stew pot.</li>
<li>Pour 1/2 c <b>Stock</b> into the skillet, bring to a boil and scrape 
  up the fond adhering to the skillet. Pour all into the pot along with 
  the rest of the <b>Stock</b></li>
<li>Stir in <b>Seasoning mix</b>, Bring to a boil, then simmer very slowly 
  for about 1-1/2 hours or as needed to bring the meat almost tender.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Peppers</b> and <b>Sauerkraut</b>. Simmer another 45 
  minutes.</li> 
<li>Meanwhile: &nbsp; Set <b>Sour Cream</b> out to warm to room 
  temperature and boil <b>Potatoes</b>.</li>
<li>When nearly ready to serve, stir 2 T of the sauce into the <b>Sour 
  Cream</b>, then stir back into the pot and bring back to a simmer.</li>
<li>Check seasoning and sourness to taste. Serve arranged and garnished as 
  desired.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Pork:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is boneless and with all excess fat 
  removed. Shoulder is good here, but leg will do fine as well. Loin is 
  a bit too tender and lacks flavor.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Hungarian Pepper:</h3> &nbsp; These are yellow-green peppers with 
  no or nearly no heat. For details see our  
  <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/ingred/cp_hungz.html"><b>Hungarian Pepper</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; White Rose or similar work well in recipes 
  of this sort. Avoid Klondike Gold type potatoes - they quickly turn 
  to mush if cooked longer than the minimum. For details see our 
  <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/ingred/ns_potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Paprika:</h3> &nbsp; Please, real Hungarian paprika - not that 
  red sawdust they sell in the supermarkets. The first 1/2 T can be 
  Hot Paprika if you like, the second is added at the end and should be 
  sweet, both for flavor and color.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Sauerkraut:</h3> A lot depends on the quality of the sauerkraut. 
  Choose one that's fresh, crisp, sharp and tastes good right out of the 
  jar or bag. I've had good results with Vitarol brand and some other 
  Polish sauerkrauts. Alas, Meter's Wisconsin Kraut is no longer 
  available.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Lard:</h3> &nbsp; If it isn't fried in lard it just isn't 
  Hungarian. Not to worry, lard isn't nearly as bad for you as the deadly 
  trans fats you were told to use instead - and you survived those (we 
  hope). If you must, you can use non-virgin olive oil, or better, 
  Avocado oil. For details see our <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/ingred/ap_lardz.html">
  <b>Lard</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>The Story:</h3> &nbsp; A famous writer/journalist, 
  J&oacute;zsef Sz&eacute;kely (say-ki-ee), showed up at a restaurant at 
  closing time. All they had left was a little pork guly&aacute;s and 
  some sauerkraut. He was hungry so he told the cook to mix it all 
  together to make a meal. He liked it and people started asking for 
  "Sz&eacute;kely's Guly&aacute;s". That was about 1846, and the dish has 
  been popular in Hungary ever since. As with most food stories involving 
  famous people it's not likely true. Some reliable sources do refer the 
  recipe to the Sz&eacute;kely in Transylvania (now in Romania) and a 
  similar <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/recipes/oom_cowgoulsk1.html"><b>Beef Guly&aacute;s with 
  Sauerkraut</b></a> is named for a specific Sz&eacute;kely subtribe, the 
  Cs&aacute;ng&oacute;s. According to the Gundel sons, who do attribute 
  the name to J&aacute;zsef Sz&eacute;kely, this recipe was originally 
  made with three kinds of meat but is now almost always just pork. That 
  conflicts a little with the story too, though not fatally.</li>
