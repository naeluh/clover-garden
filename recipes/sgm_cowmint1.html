A delicious and substantial salad - it could pass as a light main 
course on a hot summer day. It's sure to get raves from (almost) 
everyone. I call it Viet / California because I'm not sure they have 
red cabbage in Vietnam.

  <b><u>Make:</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1-1/2 hrs)
<ol>
  <li>Slice <b>BEEF</b> into slabs about 3/8 inch thick.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Marinade items</b> and massage into beef. Marinate for 
    at least 30 minutes, turning and massaging occasionally.</li>
  <li>Meanwhile, get your grill started (if using charcoal) or preheat 
    your broiler if using it.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>GINGER</b> very thin and chop fine. Crush <b>GARLIC</b> 
    and fine. Chop <b>Chili</b> fine. Mix all and pound to a paste in a 
    mortar.</li>
  <li>Squeeze <b>Lime Juice</b> and mix together all <b>Dressing 
    items</b>.</li>
  <li>Drain <b>Beef</b> and grill or broil at a very high temperature 
    until well browned on the outside but not overdone on the inside.</li>
  <li>Slice <b>Beef</b> thin across the grain and at a slant so the 
    slices are a little wider than the piece is thick. Slices should be 
    about 1-1/2 inches long.</li>
  <li>Mix <b>Beef slices</b> with <b>3 T Dressing mix</b> and marinate 
    for about 30 minutes, turning now and then.</li>
  <li>Julienne <b>CARROTS</b> and <b>CUCUMBERS</b> (a julienning 
    vegetable peeler is very helpfull here).</li>
  <li>Slice <b>ONION</b> in half lengthwise, then crosswise into very 
    thin slices. Shred <b>CABBAGE</b> thin and to a maximum length of about 
    2 inches.</li>
  <li>Separate leaves from <b>MINT</b> and <b>BASIL</b>, discarding stems 
    (see <a href="sgm_cowmint1.html#06"><b>Note-6</b></a>), then shred medium.</li>
  <li>Mix all <b>Salad items</b> together with the <b>Dressing</b> and the 
    <b>Beef strips</b>. Chill for a while, retossing now and then to 
    redistribute the dressing.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; I use a chuck roll roast or chuck 
  shoulder clod roast about 1-3/4 inches thick and cut it crosswise into 
  slices about 3/8 inch thick. Round is tougher, too lean and with less 
  flavor. Of course you can use more expensive cuts if you wish.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Chili:</h3> &nbsp; The amount of Cayenne pepper and 
  Thai chilis makes a salad with a noticeable bite - though it comes on 
  slowly. You can use less powerful chili powder if you want it milder. 
  For details see our 
  <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/ingred/cp_thaiz.html"><b>Thai Chilis</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Fish Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; This clear liquid is as essential to 
  Southeast Asian cuisine as it was to Imperial Rome. If you are 
  unfamiliar with it, see our <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_fshsaucz.html">
  <b>Fish Sauce - Introduction</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Palm Sugar:</h3> &nbsp; Available in all Southeast Asian markets 
  and some Indian markets. A syrup is made but I've never seen it, so I 
  deal with chunks, first crushing them in a mortar, then 
  grinding the fragments to powder in my spice grinder. If you don't have 
  it use a partially refined cane sugar like Turbinado.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Cucumbers:</h3> &nbsp; Preferably use thin cukes that don't need to 
  be peeled or seeded, Persian, Japanese or similar. If all you have is 
  the standard waxed green blimps, peel and seed them, and use a few 
  ounces more to compensate.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Herbs:</h3> &nbsp; The measures given here are for whole leaves 
  packed down gently into a cup measure.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Garnish:</h3> &nbsp; This salad is often served with a garnish of 
  fried shrimp chips, or a bowl of them on the side. I couldn't find my 
  shrimp chips so I fried up some rice thread noodles which puff up the 
  same way. Peanuts have been suggested as a garnish but I don't care for 
  them used that way.</li>
