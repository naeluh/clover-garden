Cawl, the "national dish" of Wales, dates to the 14th century. 
This is a somewhat modernized recipe, made and served much like the 
Lobsgows of northern Wales and the <a href="bmm_scouse1.html">
<b>Scouse</b></a> of Liverpool. (see <a href="bmm_cawl1.html#06"><b>Note-6</b></a>).

<p>Cawl is one of those dishes that is even better if let sit overnight 
and re-heated. See <a href="bmm_cawl1.html#07"><b>Note-7</b></a> for further hints 
on this.</p>

<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr)
<ol>
<li>Trim the <b>BEEF</b> of excess fat and cut into pieces about 1 inch 
  on a side. Cut <b>BACON</b> into pieces about 1/2 inch on a side. Mix.
  </li>
<li>Cut <b>ONIONS</b> into chunks about 3/4 inch on a side. Peel  
  <b>CARROTS</b> and cut into pieces 3/4 to 1 inch long depending on 
  size. Peel <b>PARSNIPS</b>, split the big end and and cut similarly 
  to the Carrots. Peel <b>RUTABAGA</b> and cut into cubes about 3/4 inch 
  on a side. Mix all.</li>
<li>Trim <b>CELERY</b> and cut into 1/3 inch lengths.</li>
<li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into about 3/4 inch cubes. Hold in cold 
  water until needed.</li>
<li>Chop <b>CABBAGE</b> coarsely.</li>
<li>Tie <b>Thyme Sprigs</b> together to make removal easier.</li>
<li>Prepare and clean <b>LEEKS</b> (see our 
  <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/ingred/li_leekz.html">Leeks</a> page), slice very thin 
  and chop moderately fine. Chop <b>PARSLEY</b> small. Mix for Garnish.
  </li> 
</ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (4 hrs)
<ol start="8">
<li>In a large heavy bottomed Dutch oven or similar (I use a 5-1/2 quart 
  saut&eacute; pan which just fits this recipe), melt the <b>Bacon 
  Fat</b>. Fry the <b>Beef mix</b>, stirring often until lightly 
  browned. Remove from the pan and drain fat.</li>
<li>Stir in the <b>Root mix</b>. Fry, stirring often, until lightly 
  browned.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Celery</b> and fry stirring another couple of minutes.
  </li>
<li>At this point, you will probably have a lot more fat than you 
  want, so dump it out, keeping only about 1/2 Tablespoon.</li>
<li>Dump <b>Beef mix</b> back into the pot and pour in <b>Water</b>. 
  Add <b>Thyme</b>, <b>Bay Leaves</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. Bring to a 
  simmer, and simmer slowly for about 2-3/4 hours or until Beef is 
  tender.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Potatoes</b>, bring back to a simmer and simmer another 
  20 minutes.</li>
<li>Check for <b>Salt</b> and stir in however much you feel is needed 
  (see <a href="bmm_cawl1.html#04">Note-4</a>). 
<li>Stir in <b>Cabbage</b> and simmer another 10 minutes.
<li>Serve hot, with some of the <b>Leek mix</b> sprinkled on top. See 
  also <a href="bmm_cawl1.html#05">Note-5</a>.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is after removing all 
  bones and excess fat. Any flavorful stewing cut will work.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Slab Bacon:</h3> &nbsp; Smoked Slab Bacon is 
  traditional, and was sometimes the only meat used. Today smoked ham 
  is sometimes used instead, in an effort to reduce the oiliness that 
  Welsh working men considered essential to a good Cawl (see also 
  <a href="bmm_cawl1.html#07">Note-7</a>).</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls for 
  very small new potatoes with paper thin skins. These are not much 
  available here in Southern California, and the tiny "fingerling" 
  potatoes commonly sold here have very tough skins. I prefer to peel and 
  cut White Rose potatoes, which stand up well in dishes of this sort. 
  Avoid "Yukon Gold" type potatoes which disintegrate into mush if cooked 
  just a little long. For details see our 
  <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/ingred/ns_potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Salt:</h3> &nbsp; How much salt you need depends 
  very much on how salty your ingredients were, so use caution. You will 
  probably want 1 teaspoon, but may want more - go by taste.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; I am likely to be serving this 
  buffet style. I bring it back up to a simmer, pour it into a slow 
  cooker set to "keep warm" and strew the Garnish over the top, where 
  it will get mixed in as people ladle out the stew.</li> 
<li id="06">
  <h3>History:</h3> &nbsp; One of the 
  main difference between this recipe and more traditional ones is the 
  browning of the meat and vegetables, which would have been impossible 
  in earlier times. This step is not essential, but is often done today 
  for a more complex flavor. Potatoes would not have been included until 
  near the end of the 16th century, but are very common today. 
  Traditionally, the meat and vegetables for Cawl would be cut larger. 
  The broth would be thickened with oatmeal or flour and served 
  separately, followed by the meat and vegetables as a separate course. 
  Today the meat and vegetables are usually cut smaller, and it is all 
  served together with unthickened broth. This makes it very similar to 
  the Lobsgows of northern Wales and the 
  <a href="bmm_scouse1.html"><b>Scouse</b></a> of Liverpool. Today, 
  in southern Wales, Cawl is often made with Lamb, and with Leeks 
  instead of Onions, as these ingredients are so characteristic of 
  Wales, but Beef is actually more traditional.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Adjustments:</h3> &nbsp; We are (mostly) not Welsh coal miners. 
  Welsh workers considered a lot of fat floating on the top of the Cawl 
  very desirable, and this was provided by the large amount of bacon 
  involved. For workers in today's Information Economy, this will be 
  a bit much. I made the recipe exactly as given by the pattern recipe, 
  but found it would be a bit heavy for my guests. I removed nearly 
  all the fat and my guests thought it was perfect that way - but not 
  one of  them was a Welsh coal miner. Since then I added the step to 
  drain out excess fat.</li>
