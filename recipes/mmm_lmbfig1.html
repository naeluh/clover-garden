This Moroccan Tagine blends meat with dried fruit for a lightly sweet 
dish. Tagines are stews, often served with Couscous (see our recipe  
<a href="mmp_couscous1.html"><b>Couscous</b></a>), but are as 
often served with rice, bread, or even regular pasta. See 
<a href="mmm_lmbfig1.html#05"><b>Variations</b></a>.

  <b><u>Do Ahead</u></b>  &nbsp; - &nbsp; (varies with cut)
  <ol>
  <li>Separate meat from fat and bones. Use those for stock.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2-1/2 hrs)
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Cut <b>LAMB</b> into chunks about 1-1/2 inches on a side for 
    buffet, perhaps a little larger for table service.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> small.</li>
  <li>Start soaking <b>SAFFRON</b> in a little warm water. You can add 
    it to the pot 15 minutes later. Until extracted by water, the 
    flavor can be locked up by the oil.</li>
  <li>Grind <b>Cumin</b> and <b>Pepper</b>.</li>
  <li>Place <b>Lamb</b> in a coverable pot or spacious saut&eacute; pan. 
    Mix in all <b>Sauce items</b> and enough <b>Water</b> to not quite 
    cover. Bring to a boil and simmer, tightly covered, for 1-1/2 to 2 
    hours, or until very tender. Stirring frequently and adding more 
    water if needed.</li>
  <li><u>Meanwhile</u> &nbsp; Steam <b>FIGS</b> and <b>APRICOTS</b> about 
    15 minutes until soft and moist.</li>
  <li>Place <b>Figs</b> and <b>Apricots</b> in a sauce pan with all 
    <b>Fruit mix items</b>. Simmer covered for about 30 minutes, 
    checking liquid. If it gets too dry add some broth from the simmering 
    lamb, but at the end of 30 minutes it should finish with little
    liquid.</li>
   <li>When <b>Lamb</b> has simmered until very tender (1-1/2 to 2 hours), 
     remove the lid and continue to simmer until the liquid is at a 
     moderately thin sauce consistency (it thickens as it cools).</li>
   <li>Reheat <b>Fig mix</b> as needed.</li>
   <li>Arrange <b>Lamb</b> in the center of a platter and pour the sauce 
     over. Arrange <b>Fruit mix</b> around (or see 
     <a href="mmm_lmbfig1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a>). If you want it Mountain Berber 
     style, scatter some <b>Walnut Meats</b> over.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with Couscous, bread or Rice.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Lamb:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for boneless lamb with all excess fat 
  removed. Mutton or Goat can also be used, but will need a little more 
  time cooking. The problem with all these is the ratio of fat and bone 
  to meat. Yields run from 45% to 52%, usually closer to 45%. Do use the 
  bones and fat to make stock. Modern practice includes the fat, because 
  it has been found much of the flavor in fat is water soluble, and the 
  fat is easily removed afterwards using a gravy separator. For a richer 
  sauce, you could use stock instead of water in this recipe.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Sugar:</h3> &nbsp; I have reduced the sugar to 
  to less than half that called for by the pattern recipe. Moroccan 
  cuisine tends to be a bit overly sweet for European and North American 
  tastes. If you want "authentic" at all cost, go ahead and use more.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Orange Water:</h3> &nbsp; This is made from the 
  flowers of the bergamot orange tree, about 7 pounds of flowers per 
  gallon of water.  It is easily available in any market serving a North 
  African, Levantine or Middle Eastern community.</li> 
<li id="04">
  <h3>Service:</h3> &nbsp; For formal service, use 
  whole fruit and the arrangement shown above. If using Russian Service 
  (restaurant style) or especially Buffet Service, you can cut the 
  figs in half and mix everything together. If anyone questions this, 
  just explain that the servants had the day off.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Variations</h3> &nbsp; Moroccan apricots are the 
  darker, unsulphured type, so feel free to use those if you wish. This 
  sort of tagine is also made with just Apricots, Apricots and Honey, 
  Apricots and Dates, Figs and Prunes, and other combinations of dried 
  fruit. Some recipes sweeten with Orange Juice rather than sugar.</li>
