Scouse is so deeply associated with the seaport of Liverpool, the 
local accented English is called "Scouse". The name, originally 
"Lobscouse", is of Baltic origin (see <a href="bmm_scouse1.html#06"><b>History</b></a>).

that of the Liverpool Football Club's Boot Room Sports Caf&eacute;.

<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (40 min)
<ol>
<li>Trim the <b>BEEF</b> of excess fat and cut into pieces about 1-1/4 
  inch on a side. Same if using Lamb.</li>
<li>Cut <b>ONIONS</b> into chunks about 1/2 inch on a side.</li>
<li>Peel <b>CARROTS</b> and cut into pieces 3/4 to 1 inch long depending 
  on size. Peel <b>RUTABAGA</b> and cut into cubes about 3/4 inch 
  Mix.</li>
<li>Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into about 1 inch cubes. Mix 1/2 the 
  Potatoes with the Carrots. Hold the other half in cold water until 
  needed.</li>
  </ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (2-3/4 hrs)
<ol start="5">
<li>In a large heavy bottomed Dutch oven or similar (I use a 5-1/2 quart 
  multi-ply saut&eacute; pan, which is sufficient for up to 1-1/2 
  recipes), heat <b>Oil</b>. Stir in <b>Beef</b> and fry stirring until 
  the Beef is lightly browned on all sides. Season with <b>Salt</b> and 
  <b>Pepper</b>.</li>
<li>Stir in the <b>Onions</b>. Fry, stirring often, until translucent.
  </li>
<li>Stir in the <b>Ale</b>, bring to a boil until it is reduced by 
  about half.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Bay Leaves</b>, <b>Thyme</b> and <b>Stock</b>. Bring to 
  a boil, cover and turn to a simmer for 45 minutes.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Carrot mix</b> (which includes 1/2 the Potatoes). Bring 
  to a boil, cover and turn to a simmer for 45 minutes.</li>
<li>Drain and stir in remaining <b>Potatoes</b>. Bring back to a simmer 
  and simmer another 30 minutes or until the meat is tender. If you have 
  too much liquid do this last bit uncovered over heat a bit higher, 
  keeping in mind there's less liquid than it looks like when it's 
  boiling.</li>
<li>Check Seasoning and adjust if needed. Possibly a little more salt.
  </li> 
<li>Serve hot, with <b>Pickled Beets</b> and/or <b>Pickled Red 
  Cabbage</b> on the side</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Beef:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is after removing all 
  bones and excess fat. Chuck is preferred, but any flavorful stewing 
  cut will work. Originally Lamb was used, because it was much cheaper 
  than Beef, but today it is so expensive Beef predominates. Some 
  people make it with a mix of Lamb and Beef, and a few do use just 
  Lamb. For economy, Lamb Neck is often used, with the bones discarded 
  after sufficient cooking.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Potatoes:</h3> &nbsp; I use White Rose potatoes 
  which hold up well, but not too well, in stews. Avoid "Yukon Gold" 
  type potatoes which disintegrate into mush if cooked just a little 
  long. If you want your stew more thickened, put the first 1/2 of the 
  potatoes in with the Stock rather than later with the Carrot mix. 
  For details see our 
  <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/ingred/ns_potato.html"><b>Potatoes</b></a> page.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Bitter Ale:</h3> &nbsp; This should be a good 
  English style bitter ale. One expert suggests Higsons Best, Young's 
  Bitter, Newcastle Summer Ale, or Brooklyn Best Bitter. When I made 
  the photo example, the best I could get my hands on was Newcastle 
  Brown Ale, and the recipe was not ruined.</li>  
<li id="04">
  <h3>Stock:</h3> &nbsp; I usually have plenty of home 
  made Beef Stock on hand, but not everyone does. In England, in homes 
  and even professionally, plain water is often used with two Beef 
  Bouillon Cubes and a good dash of Worcester Sauce. Of course Lamb 
  Stock would be perfectly acceptable, but a few deviants use Chicken 
  Stock.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Pickled Beets / Red Cabbage:</h3> &nbsp; It 
  would be considered a mortal sin to serve Scouse without Pickled Beets 
  and/or Pickled Red Cabbage. The Beets are considered the more essential, 
  but often both are provided. See our recipes 
  <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/recipes/bpv_beet1.html"><b>Pickled Beets</b></a> and  
  <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/recipes/bpv_cabred1.html"><b>Pickled Red Cabbage</b></a>. Persons 
  will usually spoon some of one or the other over a bowl of Scouse.</li> 
<li id="06">
  <h3>History:</h3> &nbsp; "Scouse" is a Liverpudlian 
  (yes, that's what they call themselves) contraction of "Lobscouse", 
  which is of Baltic origin (Latvian <i>Labs kausis</i>; Lithuanian 
  <i>Labas kausas</i>) both meaning "Good Ladle" or "Good Bowl". It 
  was adopted by most important northern seaports: Norwegian 
  <i>Lapskaus</i>, Danish <i>Labskovs</i>. In some countries it has 
  evolved into mashes made from similar ingredients: German 
  <i>Labskaus</i>, Swedish <i>Lapskojs</i> and Finnish <i>Lapskoussi</i>. 
  All refer back to a sailor's stew of salted  meat and root vegetables, 
  originally thickened with sea biscuits. In Liverpool, it was originally 
  made from Lamb, which was much cheaper than Beef, but today Lamb is 
  far more expensive, so it is much less used.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; Many Liverpudlians would consider this 
  recipe improper and fussy - the vegetables are even still 
  recognizable as what they are. In my defense: Queen Victoria died long 
  enough ago. Today many English chefs endeavor to restore England's 
  pre-Victorian culinary glory, admittedly with a little help from 
  France, Italy and California. To make this recipe "truly authentic", 
  leave out the Thyme and Bay Leaves. Stir all the Vegetables in just 
  before pouring in the Stock. Cook until the Meat is very tender, the 
  Vegetables are totally mushy, the broth is very thick, and it looks 
  kind of ugly. True Victorian cuisine for period re-enactment events!
