This delicious dish is usually served as an appetizer, but two or three 
are excellent for a satisfying light lunch. These can be made well ahead,

  <b><u>Prep Chilis</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20 min)
  <ol>
  <li>Blast the <b>CHILIS</b> black with your propane torch and brush the 
    skins off under running water.</li>
  <li>With a small knife, make shallow cuts around the flanges that 
    surround the stems of the <b>Chilis</b>. Holding the Chili firmly 
    around the big end, push the stem into it a ways, then pull it out. 
    Cut off the seed mass, but leave enough so the stem can act as a plug. 
    Shake out the seeds. A small grapefruit spoon is good for removing 
    membranes that won't come out by shaking (I also use long nosed 
    pliers). Keep the stem plugs with their respective chilis.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Prep Sauce</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (35 min, 5 min work &nbsp; - 
    &nbsp; let cook while making stuffing)
  <ol start="3">
  <li>Chop <b>ONION</b> fine.</li>
  <li>In a small sauce pan, heat 1 T <b>Olive Oil</b> and stir in 
    <b>Onion</b> and <b>Salt</b>. Fry over low flame, stirring often, 
    until light golden. Stir in <b>Tomato Sauce</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. 
    Cover tightly and simmer for about 20 minutes. When ready to use, 
    adjust as needed with boiled water, it should be quite liquid.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>Prep Stuffing &amp; Stuff</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>Poach <b>FISH FILLETS</b> in simmering salted water 5 to 10 minutes, 
    depending on thickness. Drain, cool and chop fine.</li>
  <li>Cook <b>POTATO</b> in boiling water until cooked through. Cool and 
    chop fine.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> very fine.</li> 
  <li>Chop <b>PARSLEY</b> fine.</li>
  <li>Grind <b>Coriander</b> and <b>Cumin</b> in your spice grinder.</li> 
  <li>Crumble <b>Bread</b>. Mix and mash together all <b>Stuffing 
    Items</b> until even.</li> 
  <li>Use a <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/ke/ke_pipebg1.html"><b>Pastry Piping Bag</b></a> 
    with a 1/2 inch round nozzle to stuff the peppers. Replace the stem 
    plugs. I use 2/3 of a toothpick poked lengthwise into the inside of 
    the plug to help secure it to the stuffing.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>Finish</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (15 to 30 minutes depending)
  <ol start="12">
  <li>In a spacious skillet, heat about 1/4 inch of <b>Olive Oil</b> to 
    about 365&deg;F / 185&deg;C. Fry stuffed <b>Chilis</b> three or four 
    at a time for about 8 to 10 minutes, depending on size, turning 
    several times. I like a core temperature of about 165&deg;F / 
    75&deg;C so the egg binding is set well.</li>
  <li>Serve warm, over a scoop of <b>Tomato Sauce</b>. See 
    <a href="maf_cpfish1.html#05"><b>Note-5</b></a> for buffet service.</li>
  </ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chilis:</h3> &nbsp; Small green Anaheims work well 
  for this recipe, about 5-1/2 inches long by 1-1/2 inches diameter at 
  the big end. Select straight ones for easy frying. 9 chilis will be 20 
  ounces or a bit more in this size. For details see our 
  <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html">Chilis Page</a>.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Tomato Sauce:</h3> &nbsp; Use a very simple tomato 
  sauce without strong seasonings. I use Faraon brand "Spanish style" 
  which comes in convenient 8 ounce cans, but other simple sauces will 
  work.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Fish Fillet:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls 
  for Whiting, but other light ocean fish will work fine. The photo 
  example was made with Tilapia, because I always have frozen Tilapia 
  fillets on hand. It's not an ocean fish, but it is a North African fish, 
  and it worked fine.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Harissa:</h3> &nbsp; This is the hot sauce of 
  Tunisia. Most canned Harissa is pretty awful - best to make it yourself 
  - see our recipe <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/recipes/mjv_harissa1.html"><b>Harissa</b></a>. 
  2 T by our recipe will give a just noticeable hotness to the stuffing.
  </li>  
<li id="05">
  <h3>Service:</h3> &nbsp; For buffet service, you'll 
  probably be making at least a dozen, and they can be made even days in 
  advance, right through the frying step. Make at least half again the 
  amount of sauce per chili called for above. Place the Sauce in an 
  electric skillet (or similar contraption). Cut the chilis into 3 
  unequal parts (short at thick end, long at pointy end) and place them 
  over the sauce. Cut them straight across, rather than diagonally as in 
  the photo  above, so they hold together better. Warm them to a simmer 
  and turn the skillet down to "Warm". Keep covered through warming. 
  Leftovers can be reheated this same way, over some sauce and covered 
  on the stovetop, or in the oven.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Method:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe makes no mention of skinning 
  the chilis. Skin-on, they blister fiercely, and the tough browned skin 
  makes them difficult to eat. The pattern recipe also doesn't fry them 
  long enough to set the eggs that bind the stuffing. Their photo looks 
  really nice with pretty green chilis, but careful examination suggests 
  the photographers fried the chilis lightly, and then carefully peeled 
  away the blistered skin - nice looking, but a bit tedious. If you want 
  pretty green chilis by my recipe, just steam them instead of frying 
  them - slightly different flavor.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; This is a specialty of the port city of 
  Bizerte, at the for northern tip of Tunisia. In most of Tunisia, a 
  Lamb or Beef stuffing is used in chilis.</li>
