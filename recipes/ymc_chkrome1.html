<p>I have adhered to the original recipe to the extent feasible - well, 
almost - see the notes below.</p>
  <b><u>PREP</u></b>
  <ol>
  <li>Cut <b>CHICKEN</b> into large bite-size pieces or as appropriate. 
    See <a href="ymc_chkrome1.html#01"><b>Note-1</b></a>.</li>
  <li>Grind together <b>Peppercorns</b> and <b>Asafoetida</b> to a fine 
    powder. Sprinkle over the <b>Chicken</b> and tumble until evenly 
    coated. Set aside.</li>
  <li>Grind together <b>Peppercorns</b>, <b>Cumin</b> and 
    <b>Coriander</b>.</li>
  <li>Dry roast <b>ALMONDS</b> until just golden. Cool thoroughly and 
    grind them to powder. This is not easy  - see <a href="ymc_chkrome1.html#09">
    <b>Note-9</b></a>.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>RUE</b> and <b>LOVAGE</b> fine.</li>
  <li>Chop <b>FIGS</b> fine. Chop <b>LASER ROOT</b> fine (see 
    <a href="ymc_chkrome1.html#05"><b>Note-6</b></a>).</li>
  <li>Mix <b>ALL Sauce Items</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b>
  <ol start="8">
  <li>Heat <b>Oil</b> and fry <b>Chicken</b> until it is lightly browned. 
    Keep the oil temperature moderate so chicken is cooked through by 
    time it's browned - or - roast it in an oven preheated to 
    400&deg;F/200&deg;C. See <a href="ymc_chkrome1.html#08"><b>Note-7</b></a>. Drain 
    (if fried), arrange in the serving dish and keep warm.</li>
  <li>Bring <b>Sauce mix</b> to boiling and simmer for 5 to 10 minutes. 
    Thicken with <b>Potato Starch mix</b>. Pour sauce over chicken pieces 
    - or - you could do as in India and stir the chicken into the sauce 
    and simmer a few minutes to warm before serving.</li>
  <li>Sprinkle a little <b>Pepper</b> over and serve.</li> 
  </ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; The weight given is skinless / boneless. I 
  prefer the more flavorful thigh meat - after all, Roman chickens would 
  be free range with more flavor than factory chickens. For 2 pounds you 
  will need to start with 3-3/4 pounds of thighs. If you want you can use 
  thighs bone-in by chopping them in half crosswise with a sharp Chinese 
  cleaver knife. Guinea Hen would be even more authentic, but that's a 
  bit hard to find, even in Los Angeles.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Asafoetida:</h3> &nbsp; Actually this should be Laser (Silphium) 
  but that's extinct and this is as close as we can get. I use ayurvedic 
  grade pure powdered asafoetida (hing), not Indian market "hing powder" 
  which is cut to 1/3 with rice flour. Alternately crush pure resin 
  nuggets (available in a few Indian markets) into powder. For details 
  see our <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/ingred/py_asafoz.html"><b>Asafoetida</b></a> page.
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Rue:</h3> &nbsp; This herb is out of style, so the only way to 
  have it is to grow it yourself. Rue is a widely used decorative so 
  many nurseries have it. A little goes a long way. Some suggest 
  using a little fresh rosemary as a substitute. A little of that 
  goes a long way too.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Lovage:</h3> &nbsp; This herb is out of style, so the only way to 
  have it is to grow it yourself. The alternative is to use celery leaves 
  (leaves only) which are quite similar, just a little less aromatically 
  complex.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Figs:</h3> &nbsp; One translation I have says "dates" and the one 
  I consider closer to original says "fig dates". I'm presuming this 
  means "dried figs" since they make much more sense with chicken, and 
  Rome is fig territory, not date territory. Best way to "chop" them is 
  to flatten them and slice as thin as you can in one direction, then 
  gather the slices and slice crosswise as thin as you can.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Laser Root:</h3> &nbsp; This plant is extinct so you can't grow it 
  or get it at any price. Some suggest using a little ginger root or 
  fennel seed, but I'm pretty sure my solution will get you a lot closer 
  to the true flavor (See <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/recipes/yyv_laser1.html"><b>Laser Stem / 
  Root / Juice</b></a>). About 1/2 teaspoon or to taste.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Frying / Roasting:</h3> &nbsp; Apicius appears to say "fry", as  
  is done in India for similar recipes. Deep fry in a kadhai (similar 
  to a wok but deeper), wok or deep skillet and thoroughly drain on 
  paper towels before adding to the sauce. Alternately the chicken can 
  be oven roasted on an oiled foil or baking sheet (Rome had suitable 
  ovens, India generally does not, even today).</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Potato Starch:</h3> &nbsp; OK, this is totally unauthentic. I 
  suppose the Romans might have used taro starch but more likely they 
  fried wheat flour in oil to make a blonde roux. You can do that if you 
  like, using 1/2 T flour, skip the 2 T of water and fry it in the 1 t 
  of Olive Oil.  The potato starch will give a cleaner flavor.</li>
<li id="09">
  <h3>Almonds:</h3> &nbsp; Almonds aren't easy to grind due to the oil. 
  Pounding them in a mortar and pestle is an exercise in futility.  They 
  are best ground with stones that slide over each other, so if you have 
  a real metate and metlapil (Aztec blender) or sil and batta (Hindu 
  version) use those, otherwise mix the almonds with the ground cumin 
  mix (to absorb some of the oil) and run in a mini-prep processor or 
  blender, scraping down the sides as needed until it balls up and won't 
  grind any more.</li>
<li id="10">
  <h3>Cumin / Coriander:</h3> &nbsp; In India, cumin and coriander are 
  routinely used together at a ratio of 1 to 3 for flavor balance. 
  There's no reason believe the Romans didn't use a similar ratio.</li>
<li id="11">
  <h3>Reconstruction</h3> of recipes from Imperial Rome is an inexact 
  process. The recipes we have, most written down by Apicius (whoever 
  he was) are intended for cooks highly experienced in Roman 
  practice and give almost no quantities or details. We have to proceed 
  by doing what makes sense and what tastes good. I think this recipe 
  succeeds quite well on both counts. I took the liberty of adding a 
  little rue and lovage to the original recipe from Apicius, as any Roman 
  cook might.</li>
