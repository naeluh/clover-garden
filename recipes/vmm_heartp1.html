Long cooking, but flavorful and satisfying. The sauce is a little sweet, 
see <a href="vmm_heartp1.html#04"><b>Note-4</b></a>. Almost all the prep time is for trimming 
and cutting up the hearts. This can be done well ahead and the pieces 
frozen if need be.

  <b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1 hr)
  <ol>
  <li>Pit <b>PRUNES</b> if necessary. Cut in half crosswise and soak in 
    cool water until needed.</li>
  <li>Clean <b>HEARTS</b> and cut into strips no more than 1/4 inch thick 
    and about 1-1/2 inch long by 1/2 inch wide, or however it works out.
    </li>
  <li>Chop <b>ONIONS</b> medium.</li>
  <li>Peel <b>APPLES</b> and cut into about 3/4 inch chunks.</li>
    </ol>
  <b><u>RUN</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (4-1/2 hrs)
  <ol start="5">
  <li>In a saut&eacute; pan large enough for the whole recipe (it will 
    just fit in a 3-1/2 quart - if you are careful), melt 
    <b>2 T Butter</b>. When it stops foaming and starts to color, stir in 
    the <b>Onions</b>, <b>Coriander</b> and <b>Thyme</b>. Fry 
    stirring until the Onions threaten to color. Remove all from the pan, 
    leaving as much butter as you can, and set aside.</li> 
  <li>Add <b>1 T Butter</b> and fry <b>1/3 Hearts</b> in the butter 
    until lightly browned, then set aside, leaving the butter. Repeat 
    for the other two thirds, adding <b>1 T Butter</b> for each batch.
    </li>
  <li>Return all <b>Hearts</b> to the pan. Stir in <b>Vinegar</b> and 
    fry stirring until almost dry.</li>
  <li>Stir in <b>Onions</b>, <b>Apples</b>, <b>Apple Juice</b> and 
    <b>Water</b>, <b>Salt</b> and <b>Pepper</b>. Cover and simmer until 
    meat is very tender, 4 hours or more. The liquid should be reduced to 
    a light sauce consistency (the Apple chunks should have disappeared 
    almost completely).</li>
  <li>Drain the <b>Prunes</b>. Stir them in along with <b>Cream</b> 
    and <b>Soy Sauce</b>. Taste - if too tart (unlikely), stir in more 
    Cream.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with Potatoes or other root vegetables, mashed or 
    prepared as you like.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Prunes:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is given without 
  pits. Adjust if your prunes have pits.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Hearts:</h3> &nbsp; These can be from calf, pig 
  or lamb. Pig sells at the lowest price and is low in fat (78% yield), 
  while lamb is at a much higher price and comes with a lot of fat and 
  the hassle of removing it (70% yield). Pig and lamb cook about the 
  same and can be mixed (unless you are an obserbant Jew or Muslim).
  </li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Butter:</h3> &nbsp; It's not all used at once, 
  see the instructions.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Apple Juice</h3> &nbsp; This should be 
  unfiltered if possible. The pattern recipe called for 4 cups, but 
  the dish turned out a little sweeter than I like (I'm not Scandinavian), 
  so I replaced some juice with water. Adjust to your taste.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Root Vegetables:</h3> &nbsp; Smashed potatoes 
  would be good (make the sauce gravy thickness - there's plenty of it). 
  Turnips or a mix of roots would also be good, mashed or in chunks. I 
  find rice works well too, but that wouldn't be so Scandinavian.</li>
