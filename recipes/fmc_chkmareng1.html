<b><u>Prep</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (45 min)
<ol>
<li>Cut <b>CHICKEN</b> into largish bite-size pieces. If using whole 
  bone-in joints, cut the large ones into two pieces. A razor sharp 
  Chinese cleaver knife and soft faced mallet are perfect for this.</li>
<li>Lightly powder the <b>Chicken pieces</b> with <b>Rice Flour</b> - 
  emphasis on "light". In a heavy iron skillet heat <b>Olive Oil</b> 
  (Pure or Pomace, not Virgin) and fry chicken until lightly browned all 
  over.</li>
<li>Heat <b>Brandy</b> in a small pan, set it on fire and pour over the 
  chicken. Remove the chicken to a bowl.</li>
<li>Shell <b>CRAYFISH TAILS</b> (or whatever shellfish you're using, if 
  any). Depending the intended serving style you may leave them whole or 
  cut them into two or three pieces.</li>
<li>Slice <b>MUSHROOMS</b> about 1/4 inch thick.</li>
<li>Slice <b>ONIONS</b> fairly thin crosswise then chop medium.</li>
<li>Crush <b>GARLIC</b>, slice and chop small.</li>
<li>Chop <b>PARSLEY</b>.</li>
</ol>
<b><u>Run</u></b>   &nbsp; - &nbsp; (55 min)
<ol start="9">
<li>Toast your <b>Toast</b> (if used).</li>
<li>In a Coverable saut&eacute; pan heat <b>Oil</b> and fry <b>Onions</b> 
  until translucent but not at all browned. About half way to that point 
  stir in <b>Garlic</b>.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>White Wine</b>, <b>Stock</b> and <b>Tomatoes</b>. bring to 
  a simmer. Stir in <b>Thyme</b>, <b>Parsley</b>, <b>Cayenne</b> and 
  <b>Salt</b>.  Stir in <b>Chicken</b> and simmer for about 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Stir in <b>Mushrooms</b> and simmer another 10 minutes.</li> 
<li>Taste for <b>Salt</b>, adjust liquid if needed and stir in 
  <b>Crayfish</b>, bring back to a simmer for about a minute and turn off 
  heat.</li>
<li>Set a toast on a plate. Ladle chicken and sauce over the toast. Garnish 
  with <b>Crayfish</b> (if left whole) and top with a fried egg.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Chicken:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for skinless, boneless chicken. If 
  you use whole, bone-in parts - thighs, legs, breasts and the main joint 
  of wings, you'll need 2-1/4 pounds for the same amount of meat.</li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Rice Flour:</h3> &nbsp; The dusting you use for frying will 
  also thicken the sauce. Rice flour, all purpose flour (browns more) 
  and possibly cornstarch will work. Potato starch and tapioca starch 
  don't work well here.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Brandy:</h3> &nbsp; Legend (see below) has it this was originally 
  Cognac from Napoleon's own flask. Because I shop in West Yerevan 
  (Glendale, CA) I use Armenian brandy.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Crayfish:</h3> &nbsp; Weight is for shell-on tails only. Crayfish 
  are available from Asian markets in Los Angeles, live or cooked and 
  frozen, from China, and live in Louisiana, but in most regions they're 
  difficult to find, expensive, a pain to deal with and provide a very 
  low yield for the dollar. Dione Lucas used lobster, but I'm not a top 
  rank French chef so I go with shrimp. Some recipes as early as 1868 
  do not mention shellfish at all and they're more often than not 
  omitted today. Black olives may take their place (use oil cured, not 
  canned salad olives).</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Serving:</h3> &nbsp; The fried egg (as in the photo) may be a bit 
  of a logistics problem beyond 4 servings, though manageable and elegant 
  for a late breakfast for two. For a modest size dinner party, if I 
  wanted eggs, I'd make an omelet about 1/4 inch thick and cut it into 
  strips with which to garnish the serving. For a crowd, serve it in a 
  slow cooker with a basket of toast squares cut about 1 inch on a side 
  and skip the eggs. If you're going with bone-in joints also cut your 
  toast about 1 inch square and set at the side of the serving.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; According to some of the best writers it 
  can't be Chicken Marengo without toast and fried eggs for serving. 
  Inclusion of crayfish tails is more controversial. Today all these 
  rules are widely violated - at worst no crayfish, no toast, no fried 
  egg and served on rice or noodles.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>The Story:</h3> &nbsp; After winning the Battle of 
  Marengo in Italy, Napoleon demanded dinner. His chef, Dunan, had only 
  a few ingredients scavenged from the locals, primarily chicken, eggs, 
  tomatoes, onions and crayfish. From this he assembled the original 
  Chicken Marengo, served on soldier's biscuits with a fried egg over. 
  Napoleon rather liked the dish, ordered it served after every battle 
  and refused to allow any changes in the ingredients for fear it would 
  change his luck.
  <br><h3>Alas</h3>, like so many great food stories, this one cannot 
  be true. Dunan was not in Napoleon's employ until 5 years later 
  (Larousse Gastronomique), and there's no recorded mention of the dish 
  until almost 20 years after the battle.  Unfortunately, since its actual 
  origin and original recipe are not known, it's difficult to criticize 
  any of the variants as "unauthentic" - there is no authentic.</li>
