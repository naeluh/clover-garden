This flavorful salad is substantial enough to serve as a light lunch. 
This is an excellent buffet salad, as it will not wilt. Bulgur wheat 
is used throughout the Maghreb. See also <a href="mgg_blgveg1.html#08">

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; &nbsp; (1 hour &nbsp; + chill time 1+ hr)
  <ol>
  <li>Place <b>BULGUR</b> in a heat proof bowl and pour in the 
    <b>Boiling Water</b>. Let stand for at least 30 minutes, stirring 
    now and then. Cool well.</li>
  <li>Blast <b>Bell Pepper</b> black with your 
    <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/ke/ke_torchz.html"><b>Kitchen Torch</b></a> 
    (see <a href="mgg_blgveg1.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a>). Brush off the skins under running 
    water. A few flakes of chard skin left on will give it a grilled 
    flavor.</li>
  <li> Cut <b>Bell Pepper</b> into short slices about 3/8 inch wide. 
    Dice <b>Cucumber</b> about 3/8 inch. Slice <b>Scallions</b> fairly 
    thin, white and green. Crush <b>Garlic</b> and chop small. Mix all.
    </li>
  <li>Strip stems from all <b>HERBS</b> and chop leaves small. Mix. 
    </li>
  <li>Squeeze <b>LEMON JUICE</b> and mix all <b>Dressing items</b> in 
    a small jar.</li>
  <li>Shake up the <b>Dressing</b> well and mix into <b>Bulgur</b>.
    Stir in <b>Herbs</b> and <b>Vegetables</b> until evenly 
    distributed.</li>
  <li>Crumble <b>CHEESE</b> (or dice, or slice thin and chop, depending 
    on type) and mix into Salad.</li>
  <li>Chill well, perhaps even a couple hours to let flavors blend. 
  <li>Serve garnished with <b>Olives</b> (if used) and with lime wedges 
    on the side. For buffet service, cut the olives in half and mix 
    into the salad.</li>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <h3>Bulgur:</h3> &nbsp; #1 or #2 (fine and medium 
  fine) can be used - I usually use #2. Do not attempt to use cracked 
  wheat - bulgur is precooked and soft, cracked wheat is raw and hard.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <h3>Bell Pepper:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe calls 
  for the Bell Pepper to be grilled. I'm simply not going to fire up 
  a grill for just one Pepper. I use my regular propane torch method. 
  This leaves the pepper raw and quite crisp. If you feel it's too crisp, 
  just steam it for a few minutes.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>Cucumber:</h3> &nbsp; If possible use a narrow 
  cucumber that doesn't need to be peeled or seeded - Persian, Japanese, 
  European, etc. If you have only the standard Green Blimps, wight is 
  after peeling and seeding.</li>
<li id="04">
  <h3>Herbs:</h3> &nbsp; The amount given is for chopped 
  fine and moderately packed. Use only flat leaf (Italian) parsley, 
  curly leaf tastes like plastic.</li>
<li id="05">
  <h3>Salt:</h3> &nbsp; Adjust salt depending on the 
  saltiness of the cheese used. It can be from 3/4 t to 1-1/2 t.</li>
<li id="06">
  <h3>Cheese:</h3> &nbsp; You are unlikely to find a
  traditional Algerian Bouhezza cheese (made and aged in goatskin bags) 
  in North America, but other soft white cheeses can be used. The pattern 
  recipe suggests Feta, but a goat cheese would probably also work. The 
  the photo I found attributed to Algeria shows a somewhat firmer, 
  yellower cheese, sliced thin and chopped. That cheese looked a lot 
  like a soft, lightly aged Egyptian Romey cheese, a legacy of Turkish 
  rule.</li>
<li id="07">
  <h3>Olives:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe says 
  "optional" but I use them. These should be Mediterranean oil cured 
  Olives, not California Black Salad Olives. Moroccan oil cured olives 
  are easy to pit, if you make a lengthwise cut on one side, then reform 
  or cut in half as you prefer.</li>
<li id="08">
  <h3>Comments:</h3> &nbsp; The pattern recipe gave no country. I did, 
  however, find a photo of an Algerian bulgur salad with the same 
  ingredients, including cheese, which is not a common ingredient in 
  the Maghreb.</li>
