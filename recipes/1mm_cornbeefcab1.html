Corned Beef and Cabbage is not from Ireland, see <a href="1mm_cornbeefcab1.html#03">
<b>History</b></a>. The secret to the best corned beef and cabbage 
is to cook the minimum time it takes to get things tender, and no 
longer.

  <b><u>Make</u></b> &nbsp; - &nbsp; (3-1/2 hrs - 1 hr work)
  <ol>
  <li>Put the <b>CORNED BEEF BRISKET</b> in a pot including the liquid it 
    is packed with. If you're using a "point cut" (it's the cheaper one) 
    there may be a piece on top separated from the main part by a layer 
    of fat. If you cut this off and pack it beside the main piece you'll 
    need less water - and it is a good piece for "quality control 
    sampling". Add <b>Water</b> to cover and bring to a slow boil 
    uncovered, skimming off the scum until no more rises.</li>
  <li>Add <b>Bay Leaves</b>, <b>Peppercorns</b>, <b>Mustard Seeds</b> 
    and <b>Malt Vinegar</b>, cover and continue to simmer - about 1-1/2 
    hours for a 3-1/2# brisket or 1-3/4 hours for a 4-1/2# brisket.</li>
  <li><u>Meanwhile</u>: &nbsp; Peel <b>CARROTS</b> and cut into largish 
    chunks by whatever art you prefer (I cut diagonal with a rotation). 
    Peel <b>POTATOES</b> and cut into large bite size chunks. Peel 
    <b>ONIONS</b> and slice depending on size (see 
    <a href="1mm_cornbeefcab1.html#01"><b>Note 1</b></a>).</li>
  <li>Remove outer leaves from <b>CABBAGE</b> and cut lengthwise into 
    1/8ths leaving the core to hold the leaves together.</li>
  <li>Put the <b>Vegetables</b> in a pot large enough to hold everything 
    (8 quarts). Add <b>Thyme</b>, <b>Parsley</b> and <b>Mustard</b>.</li>
  <li>After the <b>Corned Beef</b> has cooked its allotted time, remove 
    it and put it in the pot with the Vegetables.</li>
  <li>Strain the liquid, discarding the solids. Remove the fat by running 
    the liquid through a gravy separator, and pour it into the pot with 
    the vegetables. Bring to a boil and simmer until the carrots are 
    tender, about 3/4 hour.</li>
  <li>Lift out the <b>Corned Beef</b> and fish out the stems from the 
    Thyme and the Parsley sprigs.</li>
  <li>Arrange vegetables on plates (you'll probably want to cut the 
    cabbage wedges into smaller pieces). Slice corned beef across the 
    grain and place with vegetables. ladle a liberal amount of the 
    liquid over and serve hot. See also <a href="1mm_cornbeefcab1.html#02"><b>Note-2</b></a>.
    </li>  
  </ol></td>

<b>NOTES:</b>
<ol>
<li id="01">
  <b>Onions:</b> &nbsp; If you are able to get small 
  boiling (1 inch and under), just peel them, and up the weight to 12 
  or 14 ounces. If medium, peel and halve lengthwise. and you can up the 
  weight a bit. If you have only regular onions, split them into quarters 
  lengthwise and reduce the weight to about 7 oz. Always slice from the 
  root end so you can be sure the segments will hold together. To peel 
  boiling onions easily, scald them 1 minute in boiling water. Slice the 
  absolute minimum from the root end, slice some off the top and peel.
  </li>
<li id="02">
  <b>Buffet Service:</b> &nbsp; Slice the corned beef 
  across the grain 3/4 inch thick. Cut the slices into pieces about 1-1/4 
  inches on a side. Cut the Cabbage wedges into 3 or 4 pieces. Mix both 
  back in with the other vegetables and all the liquid. Put out in a 
  large slow cooker set to "keep warm". Provide bowls and a shallow 
  ladle. It will be a hit.</li>
<li id="03">
  <h3>History</h3> &nbsp; When Irish came to North America, they found 
  beef and salt, both very expensive in Ireland, cheap in the U.S. and 
  Canada, so they adopted this take on the New England Boiled Dinner. 
  It is also somewhat related to the common Irish dish of salt cured 
  back bacon and cabbage. Corned Beef and Cabbage was recently introduced 
  to Ireland by demands of the tourist trade. The tourist trade also 
  brought the St Patric's Day celebration, which, in Ireland, had simply 
  been a day when the pubs were closed.</li>
