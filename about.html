<p>Clovegarden was conceived in 2004 as a commercial site, selling stuff 
for a living. That prospect has become more and more remote as time passes and the need passes - though it is still possible. Should 
this site become commercial in any way, all the information resources, 
existing now, or added in the future, will remain free.</p>

<p>The site is still under intensive development, though it gets harder to 
see that as the site becomes larger and larger - and a lot of time is 
currently being spent updating old pages to current standards - much has 
changed since 2004. It currently contains over 5000 indexed pages and at 
least twice that in photos. .</p>

<p>At the date of this writing, all content, with the exception of some 
third party photographs (credited) has been written and composed by 
Andrew Grygus, including all the recipes.</p>

<p>It is possible other people's content will be included in the future, 
but to date nobody has expressed any interest.</p>

<p>We hope you enjoy this site and find it useful, or at least 
entertaining. We welcome any comments you may have.</p>
