<h1>Philosophy</h1>
<hr class=hr2>

<p>We hold most valuable our relationships with each other. Preparing 
fine food and enjoying it together is a simple pleasure that strengthens  
the bonds of family and friendship.</p>

<p>Corporations spend billions every year to convince us that 
"convenience" is worth any price, and that "popularity" results from 
buying expensive toys. Many are so tangled in the struggle to afford 
"convenience" and "popularity" they have far less time for family and 
friends than our ancient hunter-gatherer ancestors had.</p>

<p>What keeps this hamster wheel turning is people spending money - but 
today the top 1% have over 40% of all the nations wealth, the lower 90% 
have only 22% of the wealth, and that disparity is getting more extreme 
at an astonishing rate. It's getting so bad even some of the 1% are 
getting worried. "Historically, these kinds of gaps get closed in one 
of three ways: by revolution, higher taxes, or wars. None are on my 
bucket list." - Paul Tudor Jones II (2014 net worth $4.3 billion).</p>

<p>Whether you like it or not, it'll be getting worse before it gets 
better, and expect plenty of violence. It's time for sensible people to 
be getting back to basics - and there's nothing more basic than food. 
Fortunately, delicious and nutritious food can be greatly enjoyed without 
great expense - if you care enough to learn how.

<h2>Simple Methods, Wonderful Food Made Affordable</h2>

<p>North America has always been the land of cheap beef - but that is 
coming to an end. The resources that supported cheap beef are running 
out, and the price increases we have been seeing are only the beginning. 
People turning away from beef are driving up the cost of other meats.</p>

<p>Incomes for the vast majority are not keeping up with this increase. 
Clearly, a new approach to food will be needed that uses meats more 
sparingly, as flavoring ingredients, not bulk content - like most of the 
world already does.</p>

<p>Some cultures that know a lot about really good food at really 
low cost and how to enjoy family and friends are precisely those countries 
to which American jobs are being "outsourced" - India, China, Indonesia, 
Mexico - perhaps it's time to learn how they do it. Perhaps we'll have 
to.</p>

<h2>Authenticity</h2>

<p>To the distress of "purists" there are no truly "authentic" cuisines 
- save maybe with the cannibals of Borneo and in the darkest depths of 
the Amazon jungle. In the 1500's Europeans developed sailing ship 
technology of unprecedented sophistication and efficiency, allowing 
goods to be moved quickly, in bulk, worldwide, and at acceptable cost.</p>

<p>Major articles of trade from the first were foods and spices - 
because the gourmets and the gourmet "wanabes" were willing to pay the 
transportation (and a goodly profit besides) - then as now.</p>

<p>Who today can imagine Italy without tomato sauces, Thailand without 
hot chilis, Germany and Ireland without potatoes, England without tea, 
or the American West without tumbleweeds (Russian thistle)? This 
exchange has accelerated and become less expensive with today's fast 
ships, containerized cargo and affordable air freight.</p>

<p>It is difficult, for instance, to find any recipes from West Africa 
that are based on ingredients native to Africa. Yes, a few flavorings 
are, such as native herbs and smoke dried fish.The rest of Africa 
isn't much more "authentic". 

<p>Yet "authenticity" is a major point with us. Each culture has 
integrated imports in its own very unique way and in combination with its 
own unique local ingredients yielding startlingly different results.</p>

<p>To us, "authentic" is how the best cooks in each culture cook now, and 
within personal or written memory, regardless even of what country they 
happen to live in now. By hewing as closely as practical to "authentic" 
you can broaden your experience and explore delightful tastes you would 
otherwise not think of. Ignore "authenticity", and you'll just end up 
making the same old things with some exotic names attached.</p>

<p>We are here to help you explore that "authenticity" easily and 
affordably.</p>

<h2>Vegetarianism</h2>

<p>While this is not a vegetarian site, there's plenty here for most 
varieties of vegetarian, and we try to keep things distinct as to 
whether it's vegetarian or can be made vegetarian. We do make little 
effort to satisfy hard core Vegans, as we find that satisfying them 
is pretty much impossible.</p>

<p>For the vegetarian, the aspiring vegetarian, and people who just want 
to depend less on meat, ethnic cuisines provide wonderful variety. In 
particular examine the several vegetarian cuisines of India. We also 
recommend the Mediterranean and Turkish cuisines which provide a great 
many vegetarian dishes and dishes easily adapted to a vegetarian diet.
There is also the cuisine of the Chinese Buddhists, though strangely, 
their specialty is vegetarian imitations of meat dishes.</p>

<h2>Pills &amp; Potions</h2>

<p>Current research shows that a varied and well balanced diet is far 
more effective at warding off disease than supplements and miracle 
potions. Supplements often have the right ingredients but not in the most 
useful form, and they aren't much fun to eat anyway. For these reasons we 
recommend few such potions, concentrating on real herbs, spices, sauces 
and the like and how to take advantage of them.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we are not at all against supplements, especially 
those that address specific health issues or that make up for missing 
ingredients resulting from factory farming and processing.</p>

<h2 id=econ>Economics <small>&amp;</small> Health</h2>

<p>Many American families are facing economic problems keeping food on 
the table, and it will get steadily worse and affect more and more 
families.</p>
 
<p>Back in the 1970s the fabled 1% possessed around 9.5% of Americas 
wealth, today the 1% possess nearly 40% of America's wealth, the very rich 
have 80% and the lower 90%, where you probably fall, now has only 22%. 
The lower 80%, where you probably fall, possesses only 7% of this 
country's wealth. Yes, those are real 2016 figures. This concentration 
of wealth has not been happening fast enough for the 1% (soon to be the 
1/10%) so they have financed the Tea Parties, and purchased the 
Republican Party outright, to help make it happen faster.</p>

<p>Costs for everything are rising fast due to population growth, 
increasingly expensive energy, depleted aquifers, ill considered acts of 
Congress (like making SUV fuel from food crops), and especially climate 
change. You don't believe in climate change? Doesn't matter, climate 
change doesn't care if you believe in it or not - you'll be paying for 
it - just watch the prices.</p>

<p>As it stands, the traditional meat and potatoes diet is now beyond 
a very large percentage of the American population - and it doesn't 
stand still, it's getting worse. Do not expect help from government. Our 
government is a wholly owned subsidiary of the 1%. The voters? They're 
who got us into this - almost every election goes to whoever has the 
most money to spend, and guess from whom they get it, and who they 
actually represent? Hint: it isn't you. If all this is hard for you to 
understand, you probably watch Fox News (another wholly owned subsidiary 
of the 1%).</p>

<p>Pressed for time, possibly working more than one job (Walmart has 
revealed they just presume their workers work more than one job) and 
money, a huge number of Americans have turned to the Fast Food industry. 
This is where they can get the most calories for the dollar, and get it 
fast.</p>

<p>The fast food industry (and to be fair, the entire food industry, 
including the "health food" industry) has no interest whatever in your 
health. Despite what the Supreme Court has said, corporations aren't 
people, and they don't give a damn about people. The only "health" they 
are interested in is the health of their "bottom line" - and guess who 
that money is coming from and who it is going to?</p>

<p>So, what you get from the Fast Food Industry is carefully engineered 
out of the least expensive, least perishable (and least healthy) 
ingredients: high fructose corn syrup, msg, refined starches, trans 
fats (and now trans fats substitutes, which may be even worse), fillers, 
gums, chemicals, preservatives, "natural" (actually means highly 
processed) and artificial flavors and colors - and lots and lots of 
sugar and salt - and as little expensive fresh ingredients as they 
can get away with - and they're experts at "getting away with".</p>

<p>The result is that Americans pay far more for health care than the 
people of any other country (and I'm sure you can figure out to whom 
all that money goes) yet are in much poorer health than much of the 
world. "But, we have the best health care in the world" - and we'd 
better, because we really, really need it.</p>

<p>So, if you can't fix any of this, how can you do better for yourself 
and your family when you don't have the time?  Actually, you probably do 
have the time - if you turn off the 1%'s mind control machine (it's 
called Television). Advertisement by a television satellite provider, 
2013: "The average American watches 13 years of television during their 
lifetime - shouldn't you have the best?"</p>

<p>Now that is totally scary. The average American is throwing away 
13 years of his or her life for mindless, sedentary entertainment 
and mind control. You could prepare a whole lot of healthy, attractive, 
inexpensive and delicious food in that 13 years, and you'd be spending 
a whole lot less on health care and junk you don't need.</p>

<p>But only a very few of you will have the strength to do that - such 
is the power of the mind control machine. These pages are dedicated 
to those few.</p>
