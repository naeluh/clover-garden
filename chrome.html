<h2>This Web browser has a serious rendering defect.</h2>
<p></p>
<p>(Note: &nbsp; This page may be obsolete - we can't confirm until we 
find someone with a Mac - Safari for Windows was discontinued for lack 
of interest in 2015)</p>

<p>Safari has problems with handling [br style="clear:left"] just before 
a [/p] (or even at the end of a text region not within a [p] container). 
This probem has been reported since at least 2010, but there is 
apparently no interest in fixing in the WebKit rendering engine.</p>

<p>Chrome (now 66% of browser usage (Statcounter July 2020)) had the 
exact same problem, but Google forked development of the WebKit engine 
due to uncorrected problems, and imediately corrected this one - leaving 
only Safari (17% of browser usage (Statcounter July 2020)) with this 
defect.  Interestingly, the ratio for Clovegarden visitors is 
significantly different, more like: 50% Chrome, 26% Safari, 
18% Mozilla & Firefox (July 2020), which indicates a high Mobil Devices 
ratio.</p>

<p>The defect causes millions of Web pages to display poorly, with image 
paragraphs skewed to the right of each other rather one below the other. 
This happens on pages that pass <b>W3C Verification</b> perfectly 
(clovegarden.com is now fully html5 and css3 verified, and indexed by 
the Google Mobile First spider). We have made some adjustments to 
aleviate the worst problem, but all further suggested fixes cause 
unacceptably erratic spacing.</p>

<p>Many pages in the ingredients section of Clovegarden use 
[br style="clear:left"] to make our content readable. Some will render 
correctly in Safari, at some times - or not - depending on settings and 
screen resolution.

<h2>Work Arounds</h2>

<p>Quick fixes #1 and #2 work <u>most of the time</u>, but in some 
cases nothing helps except #3.</p>

<p><b>#1:</b> &nbsp; Click on the 
<img src="images/wsize01.jpg" alt="Button"> "Full 
Screen / Window" button. You will get a  properly rendered full screen   
page. Click it again and you'll get a properly rendered page in a window.</p>
<p><b>#2:</b> &nbsp; Move the left or right margin of your page display 
in or out (just one pixel is enough). The rendering will be corrected.</p>
<p><b>#3:</b> &nbsp; Use a Web browser that renders correctly. Firefox, 
Internet Explorer, Opera, and now Chrome do not have this defect.</p>
