      <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; [Until very recently Schieferdecker was known 
      <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; only as "The guy who married Buxtehuda's ugly 
      <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; daughter" to get a very desirable organist job. 
      <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Actually, he already had the job well before the 
      <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; wedding, and there is no actual evidence she was 
      <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; ugly - just too old for Bach, Handel and Matthison, 
      <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; all in their 20s. Schiferdecker already had a 
      <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; successful career and was probably near her age]

      <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; musicians, who have recorded a huge volume of his

      <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; German opera composers, along with Strauss, and 
      <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; was a famous music teacher. His father was Jewish, &nbsp;  
      <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; so his career was totally destroyed and his music 
      <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; no longer performed from 1928 until he died of a 
      <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; stroke in 1934. Today he is increasingly perfomed, 
      <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; and his most famous opera, <i>Die Gezeichneten</i>, 
      <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; was performed by the Los Angeles Opera in 2010]

sailing ships carried barrels of Sauerkraut to ward off scurvey. The 
British also carried Sauerkraut until limes became available to them 
and they became "Limies". The Spanish carried Potatoes for that purpose, 
but somehow never got named for them.</p>
