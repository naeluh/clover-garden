<br><h3>July 26, 2014 &nbsp; - &nbsp; "Russia 20th Century</h3>
<p>
This month's program featured Russian composers who lived in the 
20th century. We heard many very interesting works that you would not 
likely hear played on KUSC.

    Ippolitov-Ivanov gives us a bit of a link to the past, since his 
    "Caucasian Sketches"
    dates from 1896. It's somewhat fitting that the CD had his work with that 
    of Khachaturian, since the latter composer has Caucasian roots, being 
    ethnically Armenian.

  <tr><td colspan="4">
    With Prokofiev's "Semyon Kotko , a True Son of the Revolution," we moved into the era 
    of the arts being subjugated to the Soviet state. Though Shostakovich wrote many works 
    vastly superior to "The Song of the Forests" and "The Sun Shines Over the Motherland," 
    I chose these two choral works because they represent the nadir of this trend. In the first 
    piece Shostakovich even hailed Stalin as "the great gardener" of Russia.

      <br><b>Sviridov:</b> &nbsp;  - &nbsp; Poem in Memory of Sergei Esenin
      </td>
    </tr>

  <tr><td colspan="4">
    Sviridov's "Poem in Memory of Sergei Esenin" is noteworthy particularly because Esenin's 
    poetry was banned by both Stalin and Kruschev. Esenin was moody, alcoholic, bisexual, 
    and married five times in his short life. He killed himself when he was about 30. One of
    his brief marriages was to the American dancer, Isadora Duncan. She knew practically 
    no Russian, and Esenin knew little English. Their brief marriage was a matter of biology
    and chemistry. Esenins' dissolute  life didn't fit the prudishness of the Soviet state.
