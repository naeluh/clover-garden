<br><h3>June 29, 2019 - Musica Donavania Goes Medieval on Music</h3>
<p>
Our program featured of music from the Medieval, a very important, 
but largely neglected period in European history. Empires rose and fell. 
Wars and trade carried influences in food, culture, music and musical 
instruments from far lands into Europe, to be reinterpreted as the basis 
for a uniquely European culture.

  <p>The body of Medieval music consists of a great number of rather 
  short vocal and instrumental pieces, a great many by unknown composers, 
  often in rather different styles, and all open to interpretation. For 
  this reason, I found it far too combersome to organize them myself. I 
  have, instead, selected whole CDs by groups expert at that sort of 
  organization, and able to maintain consistency in instrumentation.</p>

    <br>Various pieces from along the Silk Road, mostly from about 1250 
    to the official end of the Medieval era in 1399. Lute, Rebec, 
    Recorder, Vielle, Hurdy-gurdy, Oud and Percussion.

    era in 1399.<p></p></td></tr>

  <tr><td class=disk><b>Disk-3</b></td><td class=spc></td>
    <td>Bartholomew Faire: &nbsp; <b><i>The Red Book of Montserrot</i></b>
    <br>This is a set of devotional songs and dances to be performed by 
    pilgrims visiting the Black Madonna of Montserrot, not church choirs. 
    Consequently the pieces are relatively simple and rhythmic. The songs,  
    in Catalan, Latin and Occitan, were set down in 1399, at the very end 
    of the Medieval era, but most are stylistically much older.

    <td>Dr. Judith Cohen: &nbsp; <b><i>Monofonias Medievales</i></b>
    <br>While Dr. Cohen is a noted specialist in Sephardic music, her 
    expertise extends over Medieval music in general. The pieces on 
    this CD are from Italy, France and Spain.
    <br>Altramar: &nbsp; <b><i>From Galaway to Galicia</i></b> 
    <br>Celtic music from the Medieval age.
