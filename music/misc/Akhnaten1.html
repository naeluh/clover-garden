<p>------------------------------------</p>

<p><a name="01"><b>Note-1:</b></a> &nbsp; There are many historical 
details that are not accurate - but, hey, it's an Opera, what do you 
expect? Glass' reason for picking Akhnaten was as a "world changer", 
as the founder of monotheism. Despite earlier ideas, modern scholarship 
finds no possible connection to Hebrew monotheism, which first formed 
400 years later. The term now used for Akhnaten's religion is 
"henotheism", focus on one god without denying the existence of 
others.</p>

<p><a name="k02"><b>Note-2:</b></a> &nbsp; Psalm-104 is much like 
Akhnaten's hymn, but it's also much like a whole lot of other hymns 
from it's time and from Akhnaten's time. Akhnaten's hymn had been 
erased for 400 years, except on the inside of a few tombs near the 
abandoned ruins of Akhet-Aten.</p>

<p><a name="03"><b>Note-3:</b></a> &nbsp; Akhet-Aten was not attacked 
and the royal family was not killed. The fall of Akhet-Aten was complex 
and took years. Some experts believe Nefertiti died well after Akhnaten, 
though exact date is unknown, and may have ruled as Pharaoh for a short 
time between the death of Akhnaten and the coronation of Tutenkhamun. 
The manner of Akhnaten's death is not known, but he was formally 
interred in a tomb near Akhet-Aten with the usual trappings - though it 
was later defiled.</p>

<p>Obviously the family was not killed, as his son, Tutankhaten 
(Living Image of Aten) became Pharaoh. Two years later he changed his 
name to Tutenkhamun and moved the capital back to Thebes, begining 
restoration of the old religion. One of the six daughters may have 
briefly been Pharoah, if it wasn't Nefertiti. One seems to have been 
married to another Pharoah, and one was married to Tutenkhamun. It 
is hard to know the details because Horemheb tried to erase the 
entire Amarna period as part of his stabalization program.</p>

<p>Tutankhamun appointed Horemheb as his successor, but Ay seized the 
throne upon his death. Horemheb was with the Army in Asia at the time. 
Ay's rule was only 4 years, and Horemheb seized the throne upon his 
death. Horemheb set about destroying monuments to Akhnaten, Tutenkamun, 
Ay, and whoever it was who was Pharoah between the death of Akhnaten 
and coronation of Tutenkamun.</p>

<p>Horemheb ruled for 14 years and appointed his vizar Paramesse as 
his succssor. Under the name Ramesses I, he founded the 19th Dynasty, 
but died in less than 2 years. He was followed by his son, Seti I who 
reigned for around 10 years. Seti I was followed by his own son, the 
great warior Pharaoh Ramesses II, who reigned for 66 years and died 
at the age of 90.</p>
