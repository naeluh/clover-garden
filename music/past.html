<hr class=hr2>
<p><span class=bg>
Here you will find descriptions of past Musica Donavania events, 
including photographs from many, links to recipes for much of the food 
served, and plylists for some events. "Real Time" reporting began after 
Jon Lackey's death in February 2007, allowing modernization of the 
group's technology. If a monthly event isn't listed here doesn't mean 
it wasn't held, it just means the archivist was very busy.</span></p>

<p><span class=bg>Many records of events from 1961 to 2007 have recently 
been added below the <a href="past.html#time"><b>Time Separation</b></a> 
line. More will be added as they are discovered. Additions and 
corrections are welcome. &nbsp; - &nbsp; Andrew Grygus

<p><b>Saturday 22 October 2022</b> &nbsp; Music featured was by composers 
of the Southern Cone of South America, Chile, Paraguay, Argentina, and 
Uruguay. The food featured was all from the same region, and was well liked 
by all, especially the Pisco Sours. We have posted a 
<a href="invites/pl2210.html"><b>Playlist</b></a> and also a 
<a href="../recipes/zpm_sam5.html"><b>Pictorial Menu</b></a> with 
links to the recipes.</p>

<p><b>Saturday 25 June 2022</b> &nbsp; Music featured was by composers of 
countries impinging on the Amazon Basin. The food featured was all from 
the same region, and was very well received.  We have posted a 
<a href="invites/pl2206.html"><b>Playlist</b></a> and also a 
<a href="../recipes/zpm_sam4.html"><b>Pictorial Menu</b></a> with links 
to the recipes.</p> 

<p><b>Saturday 30 April 2022</b> &nbsp; This event featured music by French 
composers, both well known and obscure. The food featured was also all 
French. We have posted a <a href="invites/pl2204.html"><b>Playlist</b></a> 
and a <a href="../recipes/zpm_frog6.html"><b>Pictorial Menu</b></a> of the 
food presented.</p>

<p><b>Saturday 30 October 2021</b> &nbsp; This was our "re-opening" event 
in the late COVID era. It was quite successful, featuring worthy but lesser 
known composers, both European and American. Vaccination against COVID was 
required for attendance. We have posted a <a href="invites/pl2110.html">
<b>Playlist</b></a> of the music presented, and a 
<a href="../recipes/zpm_africe2.html"><b>Pictorial Menu</b></a> of the 
dishes served, all of which were East African, with no relationship to the 
music program.</p>

<p><b>14 May 2020:</b> Announcement of the passing of  
<a href="misc/ob2005.html"><b>Alex Bratmon</b></a> (not COVID 
related).</p>

<p><b>Saturday 18 March 2020</b> to who knows when - <b>COVID-19 
Plague Break</b> - Social Distancing!</p>

<p><b>Saturday 29 February 2020</b> &nbsp; This was our second event 
featuring Chinese composers. We have posted a <a href="invites/pl2002.html">
<b>Playlist</b></a> of the music presented, and a 
<a href="../recipes/zpm_china3.html"><b>Pictorial Menu</b></a> of the dishes 
served.</p>

<p><b>Saturday 28 December 2019</b> &nbsp; We don't have winter here, 
so we must celebrate winter vicariously. This year we are featuring 
music from the Nordic Countries, where Winter isn't quite as severe 
as in Russia, but it's still plenty severe for us. We have posted a 
<a href="invites/pl1912.html"><b>Playlist</b></a> of the music 
presented, and a <a href="../recipes/zpm_scand2.html"><b>Pictorial 
Menu</b></a> of the dishes served. We have just a few photos in the 
<a href="photo/tn1912.html"><b>Photo Gallery</b></a> because the 
host/archivist forgot to take any more.</p>

<p><b>Saturday 30 November 2019:</b> &nbsp; This was our annual 
Saint Cecilia's Day celebration at the Altadena location. It was one 
of the most successful in recent times. On this day we paid tribute to 
the life and works of <b>Henry Purcell</b> (1659 - 1695), father of the 
English Baroque, and the last truly great English composer until near 
the dawn of the 20th Century. We held the traditional solemn memorial 
ceremony at midnight. We have posted a recipe for the 
<a href="../recipes/bmm_pigsom1.html"><b>Pork Stew Somerset</b></a> 
which got excellent comments.</p>

<p><b>Saturday 26 October 2019:</b> &nbsp; "Italian Night". This event 
featured music by Respighi and more recent composers. We have posted 
<a href="invites/pl1910.html"><b>Playlist</b></a>. We have also 
posted a <a href="../recipes/zpm_ital5.html"><b>Pictorial Menu</b></a> 
of the dishes served.</p>

<p><b>Saturday 29 June 2019:</b> &nbsp; "Musica Donavania goes Medieval 
on Music". This was an all Medieval program selected from CDs of the 
Jon Stringer collection. We have posted a 
<a href="invites/pl1906.html"><b>Playlist</b></a>. We have also 
posted a 
<a href="../recipes/zpm_levant1.html"><b>Pictorial Menu</b></a> 
of the dishes served, and a small 
<a href="photo/tn1906.html"><b>Photo Gallery</b></a>.</p>


<p><b>Saturday 27 April 2019:</b>  &nbsp;  This program featured music 
from 20th Century Spanish composers. We have a detailed 
<a href="invites/pl1904.html"><b>Playlist</b></a> of the music 
presented. We also have a 
<a href="../recipes/zpm_spain6.html"><b>Pictorial Menu</b></a> of the 
dishes served, and a small
<a href="photo/tn1904.html"><b>Photo Gallery</b></a>.</p>

<p><b>Saturday 23 February 2019:</b> &nbsp; The program for February 
included works by a number of American (USA) composers - some of which 
works are not widely known, but deserve to be. The food was all from 
one of the United States controlled territories, Puerto Rico, and we 
have a  <a href="../recipes/zpm_carib1.html"><b>Pictorial Menu</b></a>. 
We also have a <a href="invites/pl1902.html"><b>Playlist</b></a> 
of the music presented.</p>

<p><b>Saturday 29 December 2018:</b> &nbsp; This was our Russian Winter 
program with all Russian composers. We don't have winter here, so we must 
celebrate it vicariously, and nothing says Winter like "Russia". The food 
was all from Rusia's former Central Asian Empire, and we have a  
<a href="../recipes/zpm_russ5.html"><b>Pictorial Menu</b></a>. We also 
have a <a href="invites/pl1812.html"><b>Playlist</b></a> of the music 
presented.</p>

<p><b>Saturday 17 November 2018:</b> &nbsp; This was our annual 
Saint Cecilia's Day celebration at the Altadena location. On this day 
we pay tribute to the life and works of <b>Henry Purcell</b> (1659 - 
1695), father of the English Baroque, and the last truly great English 
composer until near the dawn of the 20th Century. We held the traditional 
solemn memorial ceremony at midnight.</p>

<p><b>Saturday 27 October 2018:</b> &nbsp; In fairness, since we 
had "Frog Night" and "Brit Night", we held "Kraut Night", with all 
German / Austrian music. The food served was all from the former 
German East Africa, Tanzania now, and we have a  
<a href="../recipes/zpm_german3.html"><b>Pictorial Menu</b></a>. We 
have also enhanced our usual simple Playlist as a 
<a href="invites/pl1810c.html"><b>Commented Playlist</b></a>, 
giving brief explainations of the pieces on the program </p>

<p><b>July, August, September:</b> &nbsp; Musica Donavania was inactive 
during the hot summer.</p>

<p><b>Saturday 30 June 2018:</b> &nbsp; <b>Preview</b> &nbsp; To balance 
"Frog Night", we are presenting "Brit Night", featuring music from 
before Handel and after 1998.  The food served was all from the fomer 
English West African colonies, for which we have a  
<a href="../recipes/zpm_afric2.html"><b>Pictorial Menu</b></a>. 
We also hav a <a href="invites/pl1806.html"><b>Playlist</b></a> 
of the pieces presented at this event.</p>

<p><b>Saturday 28 April 2018:</b> &nbsp; 
"Frog Night" again, where we feature an all French program. We 
included a number of pieces by well known French composers that are 
themselves little known. The cuisine was all from France's nearly 
forgotten Sub-Saharan African Empire, and we have a  
<a href="../recipes/zpm_afric1.html"><b>Pictorial Menu</b></a>. 
We also hav a <a href="invites/pl1804.html"><b>Playlist</b></a> 
of the pieces presented at this event.</p>

<p><b>Saturday 31 March 2018:</b> &nbsp; This was our Spring progam. 
In keeping with older traditions, the program opened with music by 
J.S. Bach, his Easter Oratorio followed by Toccata & Fugue in D minor 
on Organ, then as orchistrated by Sir Henry Wood. Next we had 
Rimsky-Korsakov's Russian Easter Overature, followed by a large 
collection of Renaissance Spring songs from various countries. After 
that came music by the Russian Pagan group Arkana, and music by The Dead 
Can Dance. We finished with more J.S. Bach. We have a link to the 
recipe for Georgian 
<a href="../recipes/tmc_chkhrb1.html"><b>Chicken Stew with Herbs</b></a> 
that was enjoyed at the event.</p>

<p><b>Saturday 24 February 2018:</b> &nbsp; This month's very successful 
event celebrated works of women composers, ancient, modern and in 
between. We included two pieces that have won Pulitzer Prizes for Music. 
We have a <a href="invites/pl1802.html"><b>Playlist</b></a> for the 
event, and also a <a href="../recipes/zpm_women2.html"><b>Pictorial 
Menu</b></a> of dishes served.</p>

<p><b>Saturday 27 January 2018:</b> &nbsp; This event featured music of 
recent and living American composers. It was the first recent pot-luck 
event and was diverted to the La Crescenta location due to illness in 
Altadena. We have a <a href="invites/pl1801.html"><b>Playlist</b></a> 
for the program, and a link to the recipe for 
<a href="../recipes/8mm_pigchili1.html"><b>Pork & Green Chili Stew</b>
</a> served by the hosting household.</p>

<p><b>Sunday 31 December 2017:</b> &nbsp; Again, our annual 
December / New Years event. We wished to celebrate winter, which we 
don't have here, so we celebrated vicariously with an all Russian 
program. You can't get much more wintery than Russia. We have posted 
a <a href="../recipes/zpm_russ4.html"><b>Pictorial Menu</b></a> of 
dishes served at the event, and a 
<a href="invites/pl1712.html"><b>Playlist</b></a>, as well as a 
<a href="photo/tn1712.html"><b>Photo Gallery</b></a>.</p>

<p><b>Saturday 18 November 2017:</b> &nbsp; Once again, it was our annual 
Saint Cecilia's Day celebration.  On this day we pay tribute to the 
life and works of <b>Henry Purcell</b> (1659 - 1695), father of the 
English Baroque, and the last truly great English composer until near 
the dawn of the 20th Century. We held the traditional solemn memorial 
ceremony at midnight. We have a link to the recipe for the Liverpool  
<a href="../recipes/bmm_scouse1.html"><b>Scouse Stew</b></a> served 
at the event.</p>

<p><b>Saturday 28 October 2017:</b> &nbsp;  Our October program  
featured South American composers from the countries of the Amazon: 
Peru, Bolivia and Brazil. We have a <a href="../recipes/zpm_sam3.html">
<b>Pictorial Menu</b></a> of the 
food served and a <a href="invites/pl1710.html"><b>Playlist</b></a> 
for the event.</p>

<p><b>September:</b> &nbsp; Summer recess.</p> 

<p><b>August:</b> &nbsp; Summer recess.</p>

<p><b>July:</b> &nbsp; Summer recess.</p>

<p><b>Saturday, 24 June 2017:</b> &nbsp; Our programs have featured 
plenty of Christian, Sephardic and even Islamic music. Now, in fairness 
(yes, fairness, even in the Age of Trump we dare), we present a program 
entirely on Pagan themes. We have posted a 
<a href="../recipes/zpm_phil2.html"><b>Pictorial Menu</b></a> of the 
food served. We also have a 
<a href="invites/pl1706.html"><b>Playlist</b></a> for the event, as 
well as an outline for 
<a href="misc/Akhnaten1.html"><b>Akhnaten</b></a> so those who wished 
to could understand the action. There are no photos because it didn't 
occur to the host/photographer to take any.</p>

<p><b>Saturday, 27 May 2017:</b> &nbsp;  This event was an American 
Memorial Day Presentation featuring American music from Wartime and 
Peacetime - especially in hopes that peacetime will prevail, providing 
respect and honor for all. We have a link to the recipe for 
<a href="../recipes/3of_clamchdne1.html"><b>New England Clam Chowder</b> 
</a> which was eaten to the last drop.</p>

<p><b>Saturday, 29 April 2017:</b> &nbsp; Frog Night again - at the 
La Crescenta location. It was a program of French music, with some 
surprises. The food was all from French Indochina, and there were a 
few pieces of Cambodian folk music scattered in the program. We have 
posted a <a href="../recipes/zpm_frindo1.html"><b>Pictorial Menu</b></a> 
and a <a href="invites/pl1704.html"><b>Playlist</b></a>.</p>

<p><b>Saturday, 25 March 2017:</b> &nbsp; Our March event at the 
Altadena location said farewell to a very long time Musica Donavania 
tradition (1961 or earlier). Until now it has been the <b>Bach's 
Birthday</b> event, which made sense years ago when his works were not 
so well known. Today Bach has been so overexposed a lot of people are 
just getting tired of him, especially in March when his music is played 
everywere all month. This will free up March for more cheerful Spring 
themed programming. We played the complete set of Bach's Goldberg 
Variations performed by Glen Gould. The rest of the evening was spent 
with music by Alban Berg (1885 to 1935), one of the giants of 20th 
century composition.  We have a link to the recipe for the 
<a href="../recipes/eom_sgbavar1.html"><b>Bavarian Sausage Stew</b></a> 
that was very well liked.</p>

<br id="time">
<hr class=hr4>
================== &nbsp;  <h3>Musica Donavania</h3> &nbsp;  
==================
<p>The group, named "Music Group" by Jon Lackey, was renamed, by agreement 
of the oldest standing members, to Musica Donavania. This was to honor its 
origin from the <a href="ancient/index.html"><b>Chesley Donavan 
Foundation</b></a>.
<hr class=hr4>
<br>


<p><b>25 February 2017:</b> &nbsp; This event, held at the La Crescenta 
location, was a tribute to <b>Jon Stringer</b>, and his fabulous music 
collection. It featured Medieval music from Spain and the Sephardic 
Diaspora, all from his collection. We have posted a 
<a href="../recipes/zpm_spain5.html"><b>Pictorial Menu</b></a>, and a 
<a href="invites/pl1702.html"><b>Playlist</b></a> of the works 
featured. We also have a few 
<a href="photo/tn1702.html"><b>Photos</b></a> from early in the evening 
before all the guests had arrived.</p>

<p><b>31 January 2017:</b> This was a rest and recovery month for the 
hosts.</p>

<p><b>31 December 2016:</b> &nbsp; Our annual <b>Christmas is Over! / 
New Year's Eve</b> event at the La Crescenta location. The music was 
mostly Igor Stravinsky, with one piece each for Carl Orff, Bela Bartok 
and Modest Mussorgsky. As promised, there was no Christmas music 
whatever. Dishes served were all Chinese again, since that's what 
the host was working with at the time. We have posted a 
<a href="../recipes/zpm_china2.html"><b>Pictorial Menu</b></a>, 
<a href="invites/pl1612.html"><b>Playlist</b></a>, and also a 
<a href="photo/tn1612.html"><b>Photo Gallery</b></a> from the 
event.</p>

<p><b>26 November 2016</b> &nbsp; Once again, it was our annual 
Saint Cecilia's Day celebration.  On this day we pay tribute to the 
life and works of <b>Henry Purcell</b> (1659 - 1695), father of the 
English Baroque, and the last truly great English composer until near 
the dawn of the 20th Century. We held the traditional solemn memorial 
ceremony at midnight. We have a link to the recipe for the English  
<a href="../recipes/bmc_chkwine1.html"><b>Chicken with Wine &amp; 
Fruit</b></a> served at the event. Apparently it was well liked, 
as a large pot of it was pretty much wiped out.</p>

<p><b>29 October 2016:</b> &nbsp; Our October program was entirely 
compositions by Chinese composers - though not necessarily written 
in China. We did have one properly Communist composition by a 
politically appointed committee, and yes, it was pretty bad. We have 
posted a <a href="invites/pl1610.html"><b>Playlist</b></a> of the 
works featured, and a small 
<a href="photo/tn1610.html"><b>Photo Gallery</b></a>. Dishes served 
were all Chinese, of course, and we have posted a 
<a href="../recipes/zpm_china1.html"><b>Pictorial Menu</b></a>. 
</p>

<p><b>July</b>, <b>August</b> and <b>September</b> were "rest months" 
for the households doing the hosting.</p>

<p><b>25 June 2016:</b> &nbsp; Our June program was entirely modern 
compositions - and by modern, we mean <u>modern</u>. Only composers 
who were alive on Y2K qualified for this program. The 12-Tone dissonance 
of the old century is strictly verboten. We have posted a 
<a href="invites/pl1606.html"><b>Playlist</b></a> of the works 
featured. Dishes served were all Pacific Rim", and we have posted a 
<a href="../recipes/zpm_pacrim1.html"><b>Pictorial Menu</b></a>.
</p> 

<p><b>28 May 2016:</b> &nbsp; This month's program celebrated the works 
of Eduard Tubin, a prominent Estonian Composer / Conductor of the 20th 
Century (1905 - 1982). Born under the repression of the Russian Empire,
he finally left Estonia for Sweden when the Russians again occupied 
Estonia in 1944. He is noted for incorporating Estonian folk tunes into 
his symphonies, concertos, operas, choral works, ballets and chamber 
music. We have a recipe for the 
<a href="../recipes/voc_chkdmp1.html"><b>Estonian Chicken Soup with 
Dumplings</b></a> enjoyed at the event.</p>

<p><b>30 April 2016:</b> &nbsp; It was Frog Night again, when we 
celebrate the music of 19th and 20th (and maybe soon 21st Century) 
French composes, as an antidote to too much Baroque in March. It was 
held at the La Crescenta location. This year there was a bit of 
a twist to the event - rather than French cuisine, we featured dishes 
from France's almost forgotten African Empire 
<a href="../recipes/zpm_maghreb2.html"><b>(Pictorial Menu)</b></a>. 
We have posted a <a href="invites/pl1604.html"><b>Playlist</b></a> 
of the music.</p>

<p><b>26 March 2016:</b> &nbsp; This month, while others celebrate the 
birthday of J.S. Bach, we instead celebrate the composers Bach most 
admired, and from whom he learned to compose, mainly by transcribing 
and pirating their works. These would be Jan Dismas Zelenka, Dieterich 
Buxtehude and Antonio Vivaldi, three of the most adventurous and 
innovative composers of the Baroque era. The CDs were cut on an emergency 
basis - hopefully we will eventually identify the CDs and be able to 
expand the <a href="invites/pl1603.html"><b>Playlist</b></a> with 
the names of the pieces. Meanwhile, here's a link to the recipe for 
<a href="../recipes/1mm_cornbeefcab1.html"><b>Corned Beef &amp; 
Cabbage</b></a> enjoyed at the event.</p>

<p><b>27 February 2016:</b> &nbsp; This month we featured classical 
composers of the Caucasus:   Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan. Well, 
I guess we'd better also mention Abkhazia and South Ossetia, which 
seem to have rather little interest in being reabsorbed into Georgia. 
We have posted a <a href="invites/pl1602.html"><b>Playlist</b></a> 
and a <a href="../recipes/zpm_cauc1.html"><b>Pictorial Menu</b></a> 
of the dishes served, with links to the recipes.</p>

<p><b>30 January 2016:</b> &nbsp; This event featured works of 19th 
century and 20th century Italian composers. Operas were not featured 
(except an overture or two). Yes, believe it or not, some Italian 
composers actually did write significant non-operatic works. We have 
posted a <a href="invites/pl1601.html"><b>Playlist</b></a>, and a 
link to the recipe for <a href="../recipes/ymc_chkmars1.html"><b>Chicken 
in Marsala Sauce</b></a> which was very much liked.</p>

<p><b>31 December 2015:</b> &nbsp; Nothing says Winter like Russia. 
We don't have winter here, but we had Russian Music. We have posted 
a <a href="invites/pl1512.html"><b>Playlist</b></a> and a 
<a href="photo/tn1512.html"><b>Photo Gallery</b></a>. The menu for 
this event was all Russian, and we have posted a 
<a href="../recipes/zpm_russ3.html"><b>Pictorial Menu</b></a> of the 
dishes served, with links to the recipes </p>

<p><b>21 November 2015:</b> &nbsp; Our annual Saint Cecilia's day 
event, celebrating the works of Henry Purcell, the last great English 
composer until almost the dawn of the 20th century, was held at the 
Altadena location. We have posted a 
<a href="photo/tn1511.html"><b>Photo Gallery</b></a>. We also have a 
link to the recipe for 
<a href="../recipes/bmm_cawl1.html"><b>Cawl / Lobsgows</b></a> 
enjoyed at the event. This stew not English, it's Welsh, but, hey, if 
the English didn't want Welsh stuff mixed in, they should have stayed 
out of Wales.</p>

<p><b>31 October 2015:</b> &nbsp; This was a Halloween event, held at the 
La Crescenta location, with music appropriate to the season. We have 
posted a <a href="invites/pl1510.html"><b>Playlist</b></a>. The menu 
for this event was all Korean, because that's what the host had been 
working with lately. We have posted a 
<a href="../recipes/zpm_korea1.html"><b>Pictorial Menu</b></a> of the 
dishes served, with links to the recipes </p>

<p><b>July, August, September 2015:</b> &nbsp; These hot summer months 
were skipped due to other pressures on the two hosting households.</p>

<p><b>27 June 2015:</b> &nbsp; This highly successful event was 
held at the La Crescenta location. We featured music about, referring to, 
and from the Ottoman Empire.  A menu of foods from parts of the Empire 
was served, and the <a href="../recipes/zpm_otto1.html"><b>Pictorial 
Menu</b></a> has links to the recipes. We have also a 
<a href="invites/pl1506.html"><b>Playlist</b></a>, though this 
program really needs to be experienced to be appreciated, and a small 
<a href="photo/tn1506.html"><b>Photo Gallery</b></a>.</p>

<p><b>23 May 2015:</b> &nbsp; This event, held at the Altadena location, 
featured music by Norwegian composer Johan Halvorsen (1864-1935). While 
in the tradition of Edvard Grieg, Halvorsen's compositions are in his 
own distinctive style and incorporate innovative orchestration. We have 
a link to the recipe for <a href="../recipes/vmm_cabbstuff4.html">
<b>Norwegian Stuffed Cabbages</b></a>, one of the many dishes served at 
the event.</p>

<p><b>25 April 2015:</b> &nbsp; This very successful event was held at 
the La Crescenta location, and featured English composers from the era 
of the British Raj in India. A menu of Indian food was served, and the 
<a href="../recipes/zpm_india1.html"><b>Pictorial Menu</b></a> has links 
to the recipes. We also have a 
<a href="invites/pl1504.html"><b>Playlist</b></a> of the works 
featured. There are not photos because the host / cook / dish washer / 
photographer was very busy.</p> 

<p><b>28 February 2015:</b> &nbsp; This event, held at the La Crescenta

<p><b>22 May 2014:</b> &nbsp; This event celebrated the music of Henry 
Cowell (1897-1965). Cowell was a very radical young composer of great 
influence, but due to screwing up his life from pathological distrust of 
lawyers and general paranoia, drifted down to being merely "progressive". 
This well attended event was held at the Altadena location.</p>

<p><b>19 April 2014:</b> &nbsp; Our traditional "anti-Bach" event at the 
La Crescenta location featured music by two . .  ummm . . "eccentric" 
composers. Why just two when there are so many? We have time only for 
<b>Gerald Tyrwhitt-Wilson, 14th Baron Berners</b> and 
<b>Percy Grainger</b> in one evening, but we'll get to Eric Satie and a

<p><b>22 March 2014:</b> This well attended event was our traditional

absolutely to death by KUSC were carefully avoided. We have a link to 
the recipe for the well liked

performance of Celtic fiddle tunes played by Richard van Healy. At 
midnight there was the traditional playing of the music Purcell wrote for 
Queen Mary's funeral. Tribute was also paid to our own departed, and 
to the friendship of the group. We have posted a

<p><b>26 October 2013:</b> This month we featured works by famous 
Hungarian composer and collector of folk music, Zolt&aacute;n 
Kod&aacute;ly (1882-1967). While we will played some of his popular 
orchestral works, we also played a fair amount of his worthy but 
neglected chamber and choral works. This event was as the La Crescenta

<p><b>20 October 2012</b> &nbsp; This event was devoted to 
works by Nicolai A. Rimsky-Korsakov. He gets little respect in music 
circles because he was well adjusted, not gay, not tortured or suicidal, 
happily married, highly successful, remains very popular, and taught a 
large portion of the next generation of composers, including Igor 
Stravinsky, the composing business.

  not an all Bach event. The remainder of the evening was thrown open for 
  music people wished to share. We started with Saint-Saens and ended 
  with Steeleye Span. In between were works by Peter Maxwell Davies 
  (Mavis in Las Vegas), Randall Thompson and Eric Satie. The event was 
  well attended and there was plenty of food, including a chicken curry, 
  celery &agrave; la grecque and Dong'an chicken.

<p><b>23 February 2008:</b>
  <br>The gathering was held at the Alzada Rd. venue in Altadena.
  and featured the music of British symphonist <b>Edmund Rubbra</b>.
  Attendance was good and plenty of food and drink were contributed by 
  attendees, including a big pot of 
  <a href="../recipes/omm_pigkrauth1.html"><b>Hungarian Pork and 
  Sauerkraut Stew</b></a> (<i>Szekely Goulash</i>).</p>

<p><b>26 January 2008:</b>
  <br>This 
  gathering was held at the Balcom Avenue venue and the theme was 
  <b>Composers of Sweden and Norway</b>. Snacks, drinks, a pot of pasta 
  with vegetables and a crock of Swedish meatballs in sour cherry sauce 
  were contributed and enjoyed by all. Many fine and artistic pictures 
  taken by Bonnie on her trip to Northern California and Oregon were 
  viewed on 
  computer screen.</p>

<p><b>15 December 2007:</b>
  <br>Held at the La Crescenta site, the theme for this event was 
  <b>Sephardic Songs and True Carols</b>. A real feast was contributed 
  by attendees, including a Georgian beef stew that was quite popular, 
  Georgian green bean salad, Chinese pig ear salad, cheeses, pies, 
  cookies, wine, beer and coconut water. Much of the conversation dealt 
  with historic and religious matters in keeping with the theme and the 
  season, but all remained peaceful just the same.</p>

<p><b>28 April 2007:</b>
  <br>This was the first event held at the La Crescenta site, now 
  possible with long banished Andrew Grygus returning to the Music 
  Group upon Jon Lackey's death in February. The theme was Medieval and 
  Renaissance music from Jon Lackey's music collection. Ironic, no? 
  Jon's ashes were smoldering that evening.
  <a href="ancient/img/in_0704.html"><b>Invitation</b></a>. </p>

<p><b>17 March 2007:</b>
  <br>This was the first event attended by Andrew Grygus after the 
  death of Jon Lackey ended his 30 year banishment.  It was held at 
  the Alatadena location, and we do have a small 
  <a href="photo/tn0703.html"><b>Photo Gallery</b></a> and the 
  <a href="photo/in_0703l.jpg"><b>Invitation</b></a> which served also 
  as notice of Jon Lackey's death in February.</p>

Jon Lackey. There followed a summary from the event and Jon's 
goal to set up a philosophical discussion group separate from 
the Music Group. It held a meeting entitled "The Convergence of 
Science and Art" for 6 March 2004 at the home of Jennifer Frykman 
and Jim Johnson. I have a long topic introduction for a meeting

<p><b>October 2002:</b>
<br>The theme was not recorded, but the presence of decorated 
Hubbard squash keys it to October, the annual Squash Festival at 
the Altadena location. We have a very small
<a href="photo/tn0210.html"><b>Photo Gallery</b></a>.</p>

<p><b>28 April 2001:</b>
<br>An event was held at the Altadena Location celebrating the music 
of Giuseppe Tartini.</p> 

<p><b>2002:</b>
<br>The exact date or event theme are not known, but there was an 
event at the home of Jennifer Frykman and Jim Johnson's home in 2002. 
We have a very small
<a href="photo/tn0200.html"><b>Photo Gallery</b></a>.</p> 

<p><b>24 November 2001:</b>
<br>This annual St. Cicilia's Day event, featuring the music of Henry 
Purcel, was held at the Altadena location. It was also the 2nd anual 
Squash Festival, starting at 4:00pm, thus with time for outdoors shots. 
<a href="photo/tn0111.html"><b>Photo Gallery</b></a>.</p> 
 
<p><b>28 April 2001:</b>
<br>An event was held at the home of Jennifer Frykman and Jim Johnson 
celebrating the music of B&eacute;la Bar&oacute;k.</p>

<p><b>24 March 2001:</b>
<br>This was an annual Bach's Birthday event held at the Altadena 
location. We have a very small
<a href="photo/tn0103.html"><b>Photo Gallery</b></a>.</p> 

<p><b>December 2000:</b>
<br>Held at the Balcom Avenue location in Northridge, the home of 
Karen and David Miodowski, the exact date is questionable, but placed 
in December because Ron Cobb has not yet returned to Australia, and 
there is no evidence it was a St. Cecilia event (November). It is also 
a meeting attended by Jon Stringer (in wheelchair) after his stroke. 
Unfortunately, the photos were taken with outdoor film, but we do have 
a <a href="photo/tn0012.html"><b>Photo Gallery</b></a>.</p>

<p><b>October 2000:</b>
<br>A very important event, because Ron Cobb, one of the founders of 
CD (eventually becoming Musica Donavania) attended. He lives in 
Australia now but was visiting the United States. It was held at the 
Altadena location, where it was also the annual Squash festival.
We have a fairly extensive 
<a href="photo/tn0010.html"><b>Photo Gallery</b></a>.</p>

<p><b>February 2000:</b>
<br>This event was held at the Altadena location. The theme was not 
recorded, but we have a fairly extensive 
<a href="photo/tn0002.html"><b>Photo Gallery</b></a>.</p>



<p><b>9 May ????:</b>
<br>This event, held at the home of Jan and Mallory Geller in 
Los Angeles (year to be determined, but somewhere around here). Music 
compositions of <b>Dieterich Buxtehude, J.S. Bach, Johann Mattheson</b>, 
and <b>G.F. Handel</b> were featured. This event was announced with a 
very long <a href="ancient/img/in_xa05.html"><b>Invitation</b></a>, 
mostly based on the matter of Buxtehude's daughter, but it failed to 
mention the year.</p>

<p><b>November 1994:</b>
<br>We are pretty sure of November, because of the candles, but not 
certain it was 1994, but the Stringers did host at least one other 
event that year. We have a very small
<a href="photo/tn9411.html"><b>Photo Gallery</b></a>.</p> 

<p><b>19 March 1994?:</b>
<br>This was an annual <b>Bach's Birthday</b> event, held at the home 
of Jon Stringer in Long Beach. Music of J.S. Bach was featured.
<a href="ancient/img/in_9403.html"><b>Invitation</b></a>.</p>

<p><b>1990:</b>
<br>This even was held at Karen Semco's place somewhere between 
1988 and 1992. We have only one 
<a href="photo/9000mg03.html"><b>Photo</b></a> and no other 
information.</p>

<p><b>1988:</b>
<br>We don't have a record of the theme or the month, but it was held 
at the home of Ann and Karen Semco. We do have a small 
<a href="photo/tn8800.html"><b>Photo Gallery</b></a>

<p><b>14 &amp; 21 January 1967:</b>
<br>This double <a href="ancient/img/PYsched05.html"><b>Invitation</b></a> 
presents a Medieval and Renaissance music on the 14th at Ron Myron's 
apartment in Hollywood. The presentation on the 21st of "Music and 
Anti-Music" was held at the  home of Jerry Wood's mother in Arcadia 
(where Jerry Woods and Will Birkner also lived). The invitation was 
probably written by Jerry Woods.</p>

<p><b>10 &amp; 17 December 1966:</b>
<br>This double 
<a href="ancient/img/PYsched02.html"><b>Invitation</b></a> included 
Russian music on Myers Street in Burbank on the 10th, at the home of 
Tom Slover's parents.  The program for the 17th was Viennese 
music at the home of Jerry Wood's mother in Arcadia (where Jerry Woods 
and Will Birkner also lived). The invitation was probably written 
by Jerry Woods.</p>

<p><b>15 October 1966:</b>
<br>This was a presentation of Italian music played at Ron Myron's 
apartment in Hollywood.
<a href="ancient/img/PYsched01.html"><b>Invitation</b></a>.</p>

<p><b>17 September 1966:</b>
<br>This was a presentation of music by Ralph Vaughn Williams played 
at Ron Myron's apartment in Hollywood. This was presented by the 
Philip Yoiville Society, reflecting a rejection of Jon Lackey's 
domination. While the group eventually returned to Jon Lackey, it's 
nature was forever changed, with all events at locations other than 
Jon Lackey's cluttered digs and program control firmly with 
Jon Stringer.  The other addresses on the invitation are for 
Andrew Grygus on La Tuna Canyon Road (an upgraded farm worker's shack) 
and Tom Slover's parents home in Burbank.
<a href="ancient/img/in_9609.html"><b>Invitation</b></a>.</p>

<p><b>21 November 1965:</b>
<br>The annual <b>St Cecilia's Day</b> tribute to Henry Purcell and 
his music, hosted by the "Music Division" of the Chesley Donavan 
Foundation. It was held at Jon Lackey's storefront digs. Jon Stringer 
is mentioned as the "Music Librarian" so he was clearly firmly 
established within the group by this time. The 
<a href="ancient/img/MGcecilia01.html"><b>Invitation</b></a> was 
printed on fancy paper by  Andrew Grygus, Will Birkner and Jerry 
Woods on the big letterpress in Jerry Woods' mother's garage.</p>

<p><b>21 November 1964:</b> 
<br>The annual <b>St Cecilia's Day</b> tribute to Henry Purcell and 
his music, Presented by the Chesley Donavan Foundation (the name 
"Music Group" was not yet in use). It was held at 7:00 pm at Jon' 
Lackey's storefront digs at 1544 Glendale Blvd, Los Angeles CA (a 
building since demolished). The elaborate 
<a href="ancient/img/in_6411.html"><b>Invitation</b></a> was printed 
by Andrew Grygus, Will Birkner and Jerry Woods on the big letterpress 
in Jerry Woods' mother's garage.
</p>

<p><b>21 March 1964:</b>
<br>This is the first hard evidence I have of the "Music Division" 
forming an entity distinct from the Chesley Donavan Foundation. It is 
a Bach's Birthday month event. I have no recollection who's home this 
was in, though since the 
<a href="ancient/img/MGbach01.html"><b>Invitation</b></a> says 
"Music Division Headquarters", Jon Stringer may have lived there.
</p>

<p><b>21 March 1961:</b>
<br>A very early <b>Bach's Birthday</b> event, presented by the 
Chesley Donavan Foundation (the name "Music Group" was not yet in use). 
It was held upstairs in the Elysian Theater Building on Riverside Drive, 
Los Angeles, where Jon Lackey had his digs at the time. The 
<a href="ancient/img/in_6103.html"><b>Invitation</b></a> was printed 
by Andrew Grygus, Will Birkner and Jerry Woods on the big letterpress 
in Jerry Woods' mother's garage.</p>
