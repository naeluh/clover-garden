<h1>Musica Donavania</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>
<span class=bg>We are a diverse group of people, mostly in Los Angeles County, 
who have gathered periodically, usually once a month, since about 1954, 
to listen to recorded (and sometimes live) music, engage in intense 
conversation, and share interesting food. The group name derives from 
its earliest <a href="ancient/index.html">History</a>. Each gathering 
has a central theme with appropriate music selected. Themes may range 
from Medieval through modern and contemporary classical, with occasional 
excursions outside the mainstream classical venue. For descriptions 
(with photos and menus), click on 
<a href="past.html"><b>Past Events</b></a>.</span></p>

<p><span class=bg>We are always interested in meeting new people who 
would enjoy our format. For invitations to future events, just send an 
email to music@clovegarden.com.</span>

<h3>23 August 2019</h3> &nbsp; - &nbsp;  The Musica Donavania group 
has been going through some thoughtful reconsideration. Due to people 
moving away, in declining health, or changed living conditions, we 
now have just two hosting households. Both have been putting forth 
tremendous effort, but we needed to find formats for our events that 
better served the hosting households.</p>

<p>We have had to take some severe steps, including selectively trimming 
our invitation list. These steps have resulted in some very successful 
events, achieving the desired balance among music, conversation, and 
food. We are now interested in expanding the invitation list to include 
more persons who would enjoy the balanced format. We are open to all 
ages, cultures, sexual orientations, spiritualities, economic levels, 
and most political persuasions.</p>

<p>You can get a good idea what our events are like by checking out our 
<a href="past.html"><b>Past Events</b></a> page - and let us know if 
you are interested, <b>music@clovegarden.com</b>.

<h3>March 2020 and On</h3> &nbsp; As of October 2021, we have re-started 
holding events. COVID is not over, but everyone has had plenty of time to 
get vaccinated, and vaccination is required to attend.
