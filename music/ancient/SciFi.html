<p>Then there was the <b>Chesley Donovan Foundation</b> [sic], a 
mystery to most of fandom. Its constitution might have frightened fans 
if they had a chance to read it because it spoke of members . . </p>

<blockquote>"whose lives are dedicated to the pursuit of truth through 
the practice of the fine arts, philosophy and natural sciences. The 
purpose of the organization shall be to encourage persons to develop 
creative ability and to produce worthwhile works, to organize 
cooperative efforts and projects, and to aid members in receiving 
recognition for their products - thereby serving the community".
</blockquote>
<p>The Chesley Donovan Foundation had [sic] been formed in 1953 or 
possibly a bit earlier. For a while it maintained such a hectic pace 
that it met twice weekly, and it published for a while a fanzine called 
<i>Magnitudes</i>. However, the foundation had little direct contact 
with mainstream fandom, it was not exclusively a fannish group, and 
it might have remained even more obscure except for two facts. It 
sponsored some Westercons and it had some members who became active 
in general fandom, like Helen Urban, Jon Lackey, Ron Cobb, Ralph 
Stapenhorst and Larry Ware.  Old time fan Roy Squires was an active 
member for a while too.  There is a theory that this was the group 
which inspired the persistent rumor of a big elite fan group in 
Los Angeles which deliberately and successfully hid its existence 
from fandom in general.</p>
