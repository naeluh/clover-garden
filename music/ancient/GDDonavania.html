From near its founding to the mid 1950s, the Donavainians have been an

<p>"From the Twelfth Century to the Sixteenth, the ancient seat 
of power diminished in its sway in the Valley of the Danube; yet as 
the attention of the outside world grew less, their impression upon 
history would grow greater. For, without the desire to seek popular 
acceptance or to curry favor in the courts of burgeoning new empires, 
they only sought their higher ideals, and so earned favor of 
generations who would later realize their greatness."</p>

<blockquote> - Very panegyrical; should instead emphasize the grotesque, 
eccentric, encrusted tradition, uncompromising, anachronistic . . . .
</blockquote> 

<hr class=hr2>
<br>

<h2>Origins:</h2>

<p>Where the Donavanians came from is unknown - and there are currently 
no identifiable Donavanians to do genetic testing on. The Donavanian 
language is basically Slavic, but of a wildly divergent form. It is 
said to include many ancient Egyptian words, but this is difficult 
to confirm, as the language hasn't been substantially translated.</p>

<p>The Donavan family claimed to be descended from Akhnaten, the 
heretic Pharaoh with his heretical worship of the Aten. There is 
no shred of evidence for this. There are stories about how this 
happened, but they are a bit fanciful, depending on a time-space 
warp extending from the Sinai to the Danube valley.</p>

<p>What is known is that they formed a small country, later called the 
Grand Duchy of Donavania, in the Danube Valley. The exact location 
is not currently known.</p>

<p>The total of our knowledge has come from two sources: the famous 
California Scrolls, of which three have been discovered, all bearing 
the same text, which is the first presented below, and a great batch 
of material consisting of letters, bound volumes, diaries and 
pictures collected from libraries in Germany and Czechoslovakia by 
the late Dr. Funfzig Beerstein of the Leipzig Library just after 
World War II, and retrieved by the Foundation in 1954.</p>

<p>The scrolls are in English. The remainder of the material is in 
Latin, English and (the greatest portion by far) a private language 
that has been named <u>Donavanian</u>.</p>

<p>It must be pointed out that Donavanian has not been deciphered. The 
Latin and English texts give many clues, and much has been 
accomplished, but only a small fraction of the Donavanian texts can 
be rendered with any assurance, and composition in Donavanian would be 
pure speculation at the present time.</p>

<p>It must be made clear that the texts presented here represent almost 
all that is known surely, except for what hints and hunches can be got 
from the fractional translations of the Donavanian texts, and widely 
circulated but totally unconfirmed rumors that a colony of Donavanians 
still lives secretly in Eastern Europe.</p>
<br>

<h2>I. &nbsp; The California Scrolls:</h2>

<p>The first was discovered on September 30 1953, barely readable; the 
second was found late in 1954, and the third in Glendale California in 
1958. The text below is collected from all three scrolls, which probably 
all had exactly the same text, although their varying states of 
preservation makes this speculative. Size: 14 by 17, 1/16 inch copper 
flashing, rolled and buried without protection in the earth.</p>

<blockquote>I, Chesley Donavan, on the second day of February of 1822 
do sit in this heathen land and write this in sight of possible death, 
and in determination that my work shall continue.  Let those who read 
this who seek the true spirit of Man look in the arts - which are 
Music, Painting, Sculpture, Literature and Philosophy. Let those who 
fall faint in the work of life know that labor in the interests of 
creative art is ordained to consummate success because it is action 
parallel to the most fundamental law of human endeavor. Let you 
who read this know that he who writes this stands deceived, abandoned, 
homeless in a strange land, and unable to help those who are entrusted 
to him - yet the strength of this Truth does fill his empty body and 
warm his cold hands.</blockquote>
<br>

<h2>II. &nbsp; Letter in Latin:</h2>

<p>The following letter was written in Latin and copied over as an 
exercise in penmanship some time around 1775. When the original may 
have been written is not known. 17 x 36 inches on vellum.</p>

<blockquote><p>I have been dying for several weeks now, we have all 
known. As I have departed more and more from health, you have to assume 
my responsibilities and duties, and now the time has come for you to 
take over completely. Immediately as you receive this, contact the
Ikhnaton in the customary manner and have him arrange the ceremony. 
You will find the signed papers in the right hand bottom drawer of 
my office desk, under the false bottom. I know you will do what I would 
wish you to do, for I have come to know you well in our years together. 
We have discussed this moment many times, and now that it is here I 
know you will carry forward and embody my life after my body has died.
</p>

<p>Many times we spoke of the pleasures of life, My Son. Perhaps you 
have thought of this; but it is difficult for the young to imagine 
a time when one looks forward with anguished dread to the next time 
one will be allowed to stand on one's own feet - because perhaps it 
will be the last, how one begs one's body to hold together long 
enough to enable the tasting of food just once more. The pains 
that wash me are old friends now as they prepare me for cremation. 
They may succeed in making me dread life, but I think they will not. 
For the memories I have of my rich life, of which you are a part, 
are much clearer to me now than ever.</p>

<p>Do not attempt to visit me again, my Son, for I have given orders 
against it. What you would see in this bed is something you should 
never see. I have ordered the musicians to play for me from behind a 
screen so they might not have to look at me. The servants will 
dispose of me when I have finished, and you must forget me, now. 
Remember that you cannot dishonor me by forgetting me, for you are 
my body and mind and will, and as they continue in you, so do I 
continue. remember that as you act, I act, and that nothing you could 
ever do would be displeasing to my memory, for it is my memory that 
created you, and my determination that you should be an individual 
has made you free to act, in my will, as you choose.  Remember this 
well, for the world is full of idiots who will pry at you with 
sentiments and tell you otherwise.</p>

<p>The leaving of life is not something I do without longing, yet we 
both know my time is dead before me. The world changes fast, and as 
we fit ourselves to combat it, we measure our niche of life, and 
there lies our certain doom. The world of life is not one I know, but 
one that is foreign; it is your world to rule, to conquer, and thus 
to step off your finite space, and then depart. I look back to my 
pleasures in life and, except for the music which now fills this 
room, they are already dead. The memories of these moments serves no 
purpose, since I cannot relive them, and, firmly of the mind that I 
have lived correctly, that memory must now fare as certainly as its 
contents.</p>

<p>If you would speak to me more, play my music, gaze at my paintings, 
read my poetry. This is all of me that remains of value. I rest my 
life in my works, and only hope that others may come to seek it there, 
and thus grant that I should live again through them.</blockquote>
<br>

<h2>III. &nbsp; News Clipping:</h2>

<p>The following text exists as a printed news clipping mounted on a 
board. It appears from certain peculiar blemishes that it was used for 
some time as a dart board.  Size: 8 x 9 inches on 12 x 12 inch board - 
metal eyelets in the upper corners.</p>

<blockquote><p>The dear most revered and holy Chesley Donavan</p>

<p>Your highness . . </p>

<p> Respectfully, sir, I must remind you that this part of Donavania 
has always enjoyed a reputation for the beauty and quaintness of its 
countryside, particularly the beauty of its women. Tourists from far 
and wide in the world have come here and spent much money - which 
your grace has most rightfully and justly taxed for the general good - 
and thus made all rich and prosperous. The beauty of the Donavanian 
women of this region has, in fact, spread as far as the Americas, 
where stories and fables are told about their slim and comely figures 
and narrow and modeled faces.</p>

<p>But, your excellency, your recent land reform program and public 
works projects have raised the general income in this area from 
domestic sources, thus allowing the greater purchases of food by 
the general populace. Our local Donavanian women, whose beauty has 
to this moment been widely discussed abroad, are tending to fat. 
With their beautiful figures rounded out of shape, their faces 
rounded and flat, we all stand to lose our incomes and starve.</p>

<p>We, your most humble and tax-paying servants, whose livelihood is 
your livelihood, do most reverently and respectfully petition for the 
cessation and dissolution of all the projects above mentioned in this 
area so that the honor and beauty of Donavanian women will be 
preserved for the foreign born to envy.</p>
</blockquote>
<br>

<h2>IV. &nbsp; Multi-Language Text:</h2>

<p>This text was printed in Latin, Donavanian, English, Flemish, 
French, Rumanian and Japanese. It is one of the few parallel texts 
we have to use in the decipherment of Donavanian. Size: 12 x 197 
inches - tack holes in the corners and at approximate 8 inch 
intervals along the edges.</p>

<blockquote><p>Today your soldiers have occupied our country and 
assumed police power over our citizens. Today I have issued an order 
to all Donavanian Citizens to obey your soldiers as long as they are 
looking, to protect them as long as they are awake, to be respectful 
to them except when their backs are turned.</p>

<p>Any Donavanian work of art that is stolen or defaced shall bring 
you the heads of twenty of your men. Any Donavanian citizen mistreated 
shall bring you the heads of two of your men. Any Donavanian Citizen 
killed shall bring you the head of one of your commanding officers.</p>

<p>Do not, however trouble yourself to searching for our national 
Treasures, for such work would be fruitless. Do you think that 
Donavanians cannot conceal their grandest accomplishments so that 
buffoons cannot find them? Yet if you search you shall not find them 
because they are all around you - the crass fool can wade in beauty 
for the finding of it and yet see nothing.</p>

<p>This is not the way wise men speak to equals, but idiots know no 
other language. Donavania speaks all languages to all men. I do not 
worry at the slaughter of your men for the crimes of their fellows; 
any of your citizens who have the worth to be let live have not taken 
part in this brigandage, and are either at home engaged in such worthy 
works as your majesty will allow them, or have forsaken your land for 
ours.</p>

<p>So understand that we fear you but we will not give you anything. 
If you would take me, I shall be at home to receive you. But there is 
not one four year old child in the land whom you can torture into 
betraying us, for we are strong and united in the devotion to truth, 
and we know our lives will outlive you for all time.</p>
</blockquote>
<br>

<h2>V. &nbsp; Epigrams:</h2>

<p>The following epigrams are included (in English) in Donavanian 
letters, and are excerpted here.</p>

<blockquote><p>There is only virtue - that of rectitude; only one sin - 
that of cowardice; and only one crime - that of waste. To be certain 
of the correctness of one's actions, to behave in absolute consistency 
to one's knowledge of right, that is virtue. To indulge one's cheap 
pleasures, pursue entertainment, shirk from one's ordained work, that 
is sin. To destroy what has value, that is crime.</p>

<p>The possession of objects is a trust - he who would possess without 
putting to worthy use is as bad as he who would take without paying.
It does not matter how one withholds materials from he who would make 
good use of them - whether it is by fencing his land, putting his 
musical instruments into storage, hoarding his gold, preventing his 
children from marrying, or bending his strong arm to evil works. All 
are the same as thievery.</p>
</blockquote>
<br>

<h2>VI. &nbsp; Undated Texts:</h2>

<p>The first following text is on parchment with a dagger slit top 
center. Language is English. The second text is a letter on vellum 
in rich script, again in English. No idea of the time can be 
gathered, since the persons referred to are imprecisely named.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Editor's Note:</b> &nbsp; There is some confusion 
here as the page numbering is out of order and one document in the 
set is not numbered. We presume the misnumbered one is the one with 
the dagger slit. We are also including the unnumbered declaration of 
the Republic of Donavania as the second, though we are not certain 
of this placement. Like all the other documents, it is hand typed, 
apparently on the same typewriter, with the same margins, in the 
same format, and with the same style of xxxxxxxx corrections.</p>

<hr class=hr2s>

<p>You, sir, who suggest that Donavania should go to arms against its 
neighbors, should repay insults with brigandage, should hoard its 
metals and stifle its domestic marketplace, should choke the cheers 
and cries of its citizens and leave the air silent for the water 
voices of obedient ritual - that Donavania should sell its glory to 
save its power - you, sir, have none of our warmth in your body.</p>

<p>Gladly would I give you the army and send you to South America 
just to get rid of you if it were not clear that you would as gladly 
use the army against me as against the Catholics.</p>

<p>As it is with men, so be it with nations - that life is so precious 
that to waste it in fear or sell it in bondage is the only crime. We 
shall, while we live, live perfectly, and you who say you are ready to 
die to serve our ramparts, remember as you do so that it will be for us 
who remain to rebuild them.</p>


<hr class=hr2s id="repub">

<p>Donavania, Second day of February of 1794 (new style)</p>

<p>I Chesley Donavan (1755), viewing with alarm that dreadful business 
that began in the Americas and now seems to have taken firm root in 
France, do hereby proclaim to be:</p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <h3>The Republic of Donavania</h3>

<p>Which Republic shall encompass the territory formerly occupied by 
the Grand Duchy of Donavania, with the exception of the ante-rooms 
of the High Church of Donavania and my private bed-chamber, both of 
which shall remain under the traditional system.</p>

<p>The heraldry of the Republic shall be that of the Grand Duchy.</p>

<p>The anthem of the Republic shall be that of the Donavan Family.</p>

<p>I, Chesley Donavan, shall be the Legislative, Executive, and 
Judicial departments of the Republic, and my decisions in all matters 
shall be the last word.  To this office, my son shall succeed me.</p>

<p>All persons who are born within the borders of Donavania are citizens 
of the Republic and shall pay tribute to the Donavan family as I decide,
or shall have their heads cut off.</p>

<p>Any person attempting to enter or leave the Republic except at my 
invitation shall have his legs cut off.</p>

<p>Any person guilty of blasphemy or shouting in church shall be forced 
to listen to sermons day and night for six weeks without respite.</p>

<p>The rights of the people, which are the right to freedom of speech, 
freedom to choose the state religion or death, freedom to pay tribute 
as required or have their heads cut off, freedom to leave the country 
at my whim, freedom to pay respects to my family - these rights shall 
not be infringed nor restricted in any manner by anyone but me.</p>

<h2>Appendix:</h2>

<h3>I.</h3> &nbsp; <b>The Documents Above</b> were compiled by members 
of the Chesley Donavan Foundation in the mid to late 1950s. They were 
probably typed by Paul Shoemaker (aka Harold Moss) who had the typewriter 
and the best typing skills of the group. They have been transcribed here 
by Andrew Grygus (CD member from 1959/1960) from the original typewritten 
masters found in the archives of Musica Donavania. Editing has been 
minimal, just sufficient to make them suitable for presentation on the 
Web. A <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/music/ancient/img/CDdoc001.html"><b>Typical Manuscript Page</b></a> 
can be viewed here.  None of the items in this appendix were part of 
that set of documents.<p></p>

<h3>II.</h3> &nbsp; <b>Donavanian Language:</b> This language has 
been very difficult to translate. It is basically Slavic, but of a 
radically divergent form. It includes 27 cases and 5 genders (the 
usual three plus abstractness and nobility). There is no standard 
for plurals, each noun having its own. It also includes many of what 
are thought to be ancient Egyptian words.<p></p>

<h3>III.</h3> &nbsp; <b>English Language:</b> This became the language 
of the Donavanian aristocracy when they fled to England after involvement 
in the Hussite heresy. This explains why some of the Donavanian 
documents were written in English. It was also during that stay that 
Cheslavvs Donavanvs was changed to Chesley Donavan.<p></p>

<h3>V.</h3> &nbsp; The <b>Donavan Family:</b>  &nbsp; Each successive 
ruler of Donavania, upon succeeding his predecessor, took the name 
"Chesley Donavan", thus presenting the illusion of an undying ruler. 
The actual title was Chespingus, but he was usually just called the 
"Chesley Donavan". The family claimed descent from Akhenaten 
(Amenhotep IV), the heretic monotheistic Pharaoh of Egypt - but 
there is not a shred of verifiable evidence of this.<p></p>

<h3>VI.</h3> &nbsp; <b>Donavanian National Anthem:</b> &nbsp; 
Franz Schubert was eating a fish dinner across the street from 
Donavania. This was during a Donavanian festival and the Donavanian 
National Anthem was being played. Schubert, hearing the music through 
an open windows, asked his host, "That's wonderful, what is it?". 
His host, mistaking the question as being about dinner, responded 
"Trout". Years later he incorporating this music into his own 
work, <i>The Trout Quintet</i>. This was, of course adopted by CD as 
the only surviving rendition of the Donavanian National Anthem. 
The words were in Donavanian, and have been lost.<p></p>

<h3>VII.</h3> &nbsp; The <b>Donavanian National Motto</b>: &nbsp; 
<i>Donavanyezhda Etik Hogelli Norgrizheb</i>. This phrase has defied 
translation.<p></p>

<h3>VIII.</h3> &nbsp; The <b>High Church of Donavania:</b> &nbsp; 
We have no description or liturgy from the High Church, but presume, 
given the Donavan's claim to be descendants of the heretic Pharaoh 
Akhenaten, that the liturgy was Christian mixed with some Egyptian.

<p>With the exception of Jon Lackey, members of the Chesley Donavan 
Foundation favored the polytheistic religion that preceded (and 
succeeded) Akhenaten's Aten worship - as did his son, Tutankhamen. 
Jon was an atheist, but used Egyptian motifs, mainly Aten, for pageants. 
Paul Shoemaker eventually gave up atheism to became a high priest of 
Horus within the Church of the Eternal Source. Egyptians within 
Donavania also rejected Aten in favor the traditional pantheon with 
Amen as the head.</p>

<p>Given the history of Donavania and the Foundation, we declare the 
Reformed High Church of Donavania to be Polytheistic - principally 
Kemetic (Egyptian Neopagan), but welcoming to other Pagan traditions. 
Adherents to Atheism and even the Abrahamic religions are, doubtless to 
their benefit, welcome to attend services and events, so long as they 
are not disruptive.</p>

<h3>IX.</h3> &nbsp; <b>Archivist's note</b> &nbsp; I have corrected 
the header which stated, "its founding to the mid 1950s", which is 
false. I consider this to be an attempt by "Person S" to establish 
hemself as the legitimate proprietor of the title "Chesley Donavan 
Foundation". The document itself specifically gives the date 1954 
for an action by "the Foundation".

<p>Person S was deposed from dictatorship in July 1965, by unanimous 
signiture of members (excepet himself) and we have the 
<a href="img/CDrevolt01.html"><b>Signed Document</b></a>. Prson S 
treated the name "Chesley Donavan Foundation" as his own property, 
using it in various ways over the years. Those who signed that 
document are the legitimate owners of the name. Several of the signers 
were members from around 1954, and all were members previous to 1962. 
I, Andrew Grygus, am one of the signers of the document.<p></p>
