<hr class=hr2>
<p>
This page will, as time permits, accumulate various and sundry 
elements from the wandering history of <b>Musica Donavania</b>, and 
those who are and have been associated with it.</p>

<p>Most of this material has long been recorded on paper and film, 
packed away in files and boxes, and in the minds of the members. A 
bunch of it is now being dredged up, written up and digitized, so 
this page and its links are expanding.

<h2>In the Beginning there was CD</h2> 
<p><a href="SciFi.html">
<img src="img/CDLogo06s.jpg" alt="Greeting Card" class=mrg></a>
What is now <b>Musica Donavania</b>, has its roots far back in the 
mists of time, in the middle of a previous century (early 1950s). It 
was originally a Science and Science Fiction appreciation group, founded 
under the name CD Inc. The original logo was actually on a modified Civil 
Defense helmet liner with "INC" added after the CD, and some destructive device 
embedded in it. At the time "C" stood for Ron Cobb and the "D" for 
Tad Duke. The Inc. stood for nothing, as the group was never 
incorporated. A very <a href="img/CDphoto001.html"><b>Early Photo</b></a> 
in my posession shows an original helmet with a large wooden screw 
embedded in it. For more on this very early, non-musical phase, see 
<a href="http://www.geocities.ws/fixer1977/cobb2b.html"><b>Who is Ron 
Cobb</b></a>. As noted, Paul Shoemaker was also part of this early 
group.</p>

<p>Ron Cobb now lives in Australia, and is no longer much involved 
with the group, but he did attend at least two Music Group events 
in 2000.  I haven't been able yet to find what happened to Tad Duke.

<img src="img/cd_009e.jpg" alt="Greeting Card" class=mrg></a>
<h3>The Chesley Donavan Foundation:</h3> &nbsp; Over time other 
people became associated with the group, notably art student Jon Lackey 
and small time science fiction author Helen M. Urban, both from the 
science fantasy side. Helen's only well known work is 
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/23185/23185-h/23185-h.htm">
<i><b>The Glory of Ippling</b></i></a>, published by Galaxy in 1962. It 
is notable for the really bad reviews it gets. The CD was changed to 
represent Chesley Donavan, Chespingus (Prince or whatever) of Donavania, 
a tiny mythical country somewhere in the Danube Valley. The official 
name became The Chesley Donavan Science-Fantasy Foundation. This 
organization was well noticed as part of the Science Fiction / Fantasy 
community, as shown by this <a href="SciFi.html"><b>Book 
Excerpt</b></a><p></p>

<p>As the focus on science fantasy slowly faded, it became simply the 
Chesley Donavan Foundation. The choice of the name "Chesley" was 
supposedly inspired by admiration of the planetary paintings of Chesley 
Bonestell. The "Donavan" part supposedly came from a 1942 science fiction 
novel by Curt Siodmak, "Donovan's Brain", later made three times into 
movies. This I learned in the early years, but I hear some have denied 
that in later times. I suspect the spelling "Donavan" was a typo not 
discovered until after documents were printed.
<br class=cll></p>

<a href="img/CDportrait01.html">
<img src="img/cd_008c.jpg" alt="Donavanian Man's Portrait" class=mrg></a>
<h3>Donavania:</h3> &nbsp; Much of the early mythology of the 
group revolves around the  <a href="GDDonavania.html"><b>Grand Duchy of 
Donavania</b></a>, from ancient times through its name change to 
Republic of Donavania and on to the final dissolution of the Donavanians 
as a people in the deserts of Southern California. Paul Shoemaker wrote 
a wild fantasy titled <a href="Sularia.html"><b>Uprising in 
Sularia</b></a> based on Donavanians who stayed in Europe and founded 
a new Sularia. with a new Chesley Donavan. It is in four sections, but 
we have published here only the first section as that section is largely 
based on Donavanian history from the 1950s. The other three sections 
are dated 1992. The first section is the only written record we have of 
some aspects of the oral history of Donavania.
<br class=cll><p></p>

<img src="img/CDlogo01c.gif" alt="CD Logo" class=mrg>
<h3>Original Donavanian Logo:</h3> &nbsp; During the 1950s, 
the two symbols of the Chesley Donavan foundation first appeared. The 
Donavanian "CD" emblem is seen in all three portraits on our  
<a href="img/CDportrait01.html"><b>Portrait Page</b></a> and the 
one at the top left displays the Ankh (Egyptian looped Cross) which 
predominated even past the time of the CD Revolts.

<p>Over time, the group grew, but some of the founders had departed. 
Ron Cobb, later to find great fame as a Free Press cartoonist and major 
designer for such productions as "Alien" and "ET", had been shipped out 
to serve in the Vietnam War. Tad Duke disappeared and I have no idea 
what happened to him. Paul Shoemaker was the only one left of the earliest 
founders, and Jon Lackey and Helen Urban who came just a little later.
<br class=cll></p>

<img src="img/CDlogo02c.jpg" alt="Imperial Logo" class=mrg>
<h3>Donavanian Imperial Logo:</h3> &nbsp; In 1960, Andrew Grygus, writer 
of this page, became a member. By this time the connection to science 
fiction fandom was fading rapidly, but the story of Donavania was still 
current, though little new material was being created. The "Imperial 
Logo" seen to the left had mostly replaced the original logo. I have an 
<a href="img/CDdoc005.html"><b>Invitation</b></a> from 1962, which 
was still based on the Chesley Donavan myth. Meanwhile, interest in the 
religion of Ancient Egypt was increasing, so use of the Ankh became more 
common. Also increasing was interest in music, although none of the 
regular members were musicians. Interest in music was strongly promoted 
by Paul Shoemaker, and later by Jon Stringer.<p></p>

<p>The group was meeting once a week, on Friday. In the late '50s and 
very early '60s meetings were in Helen Urban's garage in Burbank, but by 
1963 they were in whatever abandoned theater, run-down store front, 
abandoned church or other digs Jon Lackey was living in. This varied, 
for though his landlords were unbelievably tolerant of his being behind 
on the rent, eventually they'd force a move. A move was always traumatic, 
because Jon was a pack rat beyond peer.
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>The First Revolt:</h3> &nbsp;  Newer CD members became 
fed up with autocratic rule of Paul Shoemaker, backed by Jon Lackey and 
Helen Urban. A more democratic situation was thought desirable and a 
petition was brought forth titled <a href="img/CDrevolt01.html">
<b>PROPOSED CHANGES IN THE CONSTITUTION</b></a>. Signing FOR were Helen 
Urban, Andrew Grygus, Thomas Slover, Jon Lackey, Will Birkner, 
George Loring Fisk, J Lee van de Wetering, Mathew Jaro, Jerry Woods, 
Louis Panuse, and Jon Stringer. Paul Shoemaker alone signed on the 
AGAINST side.

<p>Paul Shoemaker never came to another meeting, but treated the 
"Chesley Donavan Foundation" and its history his own personal property. 
He used it for other groups, particularly a gay men's group. There is 
some evidence of a "Chesley Donavan Organization" in Twentynine Palms, 
California, but there appears to no longer be a Web site or any other 
information. Helen Urban also left the group at about this time, as 
she was in very poor health.</p>

<p>Paul Shoemaker organized the "First and Most Holy Rationalist 
Orthodox Freethinking Church of Donavania", which held events such 
as the "Blessing of the Telescopes" at the Griffith Park Observatory 
in Los Angeles. This was in keeping with his atheist convictions of 
the time. After "coming out", Paul started using the name 
"Harold Moss". He continued to expand the Donavanian mythology 
until at least 1992.</p>

<p>Eventually he became a priest of Horus with the <a href="CES.html">
<b>Church of the Eternal Source</b></a>. Apparently he took this quite 
seriously, maintaining a temple room with wonderful, skillfully done 
replicas of ancient Egyptian artifacts and artwork. He continued an 
intense interest in music until his death in 2010.  There is an obituary at 
<a href="http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2010/June10/Shoemaker_Obituary.htm">
<b>Music Web</b></a> and another on the 
<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/churcheternalsource/Home/current-priests-and-priestesses/in-memoriam">
<b>Church of the Eternal Source</b></a> site, now again available.

<h2>Roots of Musica Donavania</h2>

<p><img src="img/MGcecilia06c.jpg" alt="Purcell Portrait" class=mrg>
Well before the Revolt, the Music Group was forming as a distinct entity. 
I have found an invitation to a 
<a href="img/MGbach01.html"><b>Bach Birthday Event</b></a> dated 21 
March 1964. This was printed by members who were letter press printing 
enthusiasts. It is notable that the address for this event is <u>not</u>  
one of the regular CD meeting places.	 Clearly there was unrest well 
before the Revolt. The Bach's Birthday tradition carried forward 
until about 2016, but was getting a little stale because everybody is 
over-doing Bach these days.</p>

<p>After the revolt, emphasis shifted yet farther from science fiction, 
particularly to musical and seasonal events. St Cecilia's day became 
a major event, and the Solstices and Equinoxes were celebrated 
with pseudo-Egyptian events.  Only a few months after the revolt, 
members interested in letterpress printing turned out an invitation 
brochure for <a href="img/MGcecilia01.html"><b>Saint Cecilia's 
Day</b></a>. Printed on very fancy paper it was far beyond what most small 
organizations could do in those days. The Saint Cecilia's Day celebration 
of the music of Henry Purcell continues to this day (2019, and 2020 if 
the COVID allows) every November.</p>

<p>The seasonal events, held four times a year, became quite elaborate. 
We have a photo taken at a <a href="img/CDphoto002.html"><b>Solstice 
Event</b></a>. More photos will be published as they surface. These were 
generally organized and presided over by Jon Lackey. The march from 
Alan Hovhaness' Saint Vartan Symphony became the standard ceremonial 
march for these events. For Jon, a hard core atheist, these events 
were strictly theatrical without religious connotations.</p>

<img src="img/PYlogo01c.jpg" alt="P.Yoiville Logo" class=mrg>
<h3>Again - Revolt:</h3> &nbsp; Jon Lackey proved even more imperious 
than Paul Shoemaker had been. He kept all CD documents, history, 
artwork, etc. locked up as his personal property. No-one else was allowed 
to touch any of it. He seized the invitation lists and all other items 
of control. He had an over-riding need to be the center of everything, 
to maintain complete control, and he recognized no contribution by 
others. This was becoming central to Jon's personality, and served 
him poorly in years to come.

<p>In reaction, several of us formed the Philip Yoiville Society. I 
don't remember much of the logic here, even though I made most of it 
up myself. I think Philip Yoiville was a science fiction character who 
was supposed to be of Tatar extraction. I don't remember the logic of 
the double gibbet shield logo either.</p>

<p>One of our <a href="img/PYdoc01.html"><b>Revolutionary Tracts</b></a> 
laid out the real problem - though we didn't immediately recognize it. 
It soon became clear that the real problem was, as adults, we didn't 
need this organization and mythology stuff - we had much more urgent 
concerns (girls, jobs, girls, etc.) concerns to deal with. Reality had 
come home to roost. Today, we can look back on this stuff with amusement 
- but it is part of our lives, not to be forgotten or disrespected.</p>

<p>While the Philip Yoiville Society didn't last long, we did have some 
high quality meetings and solidified the Music Group with 
<a href="../../memorium/jstringer/jon.html"><b>Jon Stringer</b></a> the 
key organizer of the music - and that music events were not held at Jon 
Lackey's. A number of our schedules and invitations are available here: 
<a href="img/PYsched06.html"><b>September 1966</b></a>,
<a href="img/PYsched01.html"><b>October 1966</b></a>,  
<a href="img/PYsched02.html"><b>December 1966</b></a>, 
<a href="img/PYsched05.html"><b>January 1967</b></a>. These were probably 
written by Jerry Woods, though Ron Myron could also write in this 
style. Jerry Woods had the printing press.</p>

<p>Eventually, the tasks of adulthood took its toll on youthful 
enthusiasm, and the music functions were returned to Jon Lackey, though 
I don't remember the exact mechanism for how this happened. Jon Stringer 
continued to be the music librarian and organize the music side of 
events until his stroke in 2000. All music events continued to be 
held in homes other than Jon Lackey's.</p>
 
<p>Jon Lackey continued to hold weekly meetings for some time, and it 
was at one of these Friday events that Jon physically shoved me out of 
his digs, forbade me from ever to return, and I was 
<a href="../../memorium/ajg/banished.html"><b>Banished for Life</b></a> 
from the Music Group (for his life, as it turns out). The reason for this 
expulsion was silly, but hinged on Jon's tender ego and pressing need to 
be the center of the universe. I don't have an exact date for this, but 
it was apparently between mid 1973 to mid 1974. Jon also continued with 
the astronomical events, as shown by this <a href="img/CDdoc007.html">
<b>Announcement</b></a> from 1973. Neither these events nor Ancient 
Egyptian religion are currently a part of Music Group practice - however, 
under it's new name, Musica Donavania, some elements may reappear.</p>

<p>Banishment didn't bother me, and I never felt hostility toward Jon, 
it was strictly a one-way enmity. I had lots and lots of other stuff to 
do. Among other things, I found myself on the 
<a href="CES.html"><b>Church of the Eternal Source</b></a> 
invite list and attended some pretty darn good events and parties 
there.</p>

<p>Gatherings became monthly events, and were, of necessity, held at 
other peoples homes, because Jon was unable to pay his utility bills. 
Jon kept firm control of the invitation list and the dates, timings and 
themes, of what he named "Music Group". Now and then, when Tom Slover 
and Peggy Myron were in town, they invited me along to a Music Group 
event, to Jon's great distress - but there was nothing he could do 
about it in other people's homes. I remained quite cordial, and he 
remained "Harrumph!".</p>

<p>In February, 2007, Jon Lackey died of cancer, while denying there was 
a problum right up to his last couple of weeks. An appropriately 
sanitized Obituary was posted by Mallory &amp; McCall. Their Web site is 
gone, but we have saved an image of the page as 
<a href="img/JLobit01.html"><b>Jon Lackey M&Mc Obituary</b></a> 
Mallory and McCall had long before stopped hosting Music Group because 
of a strong feeling they were just being used by Jon. Bonnie Callahan 
took over responsibility for maintaining the Music Group. Unfortunately, 
Jon Stringer also died in 2007, a few weeks after Jon Lackey. This was 
after long illness during which he could no longer coordinate the music 
programs. We have a memorial page for 
<a href="../../memorium/jstringer/jon.html"><b>Jon Martin 
Stringer</b></a>.</p>

<p>Although I had never met any of the people who were active in the 
Music Group at this time, through some connection, probably Tom and 
Peggy, I was invited back in March 2007. The next month, April, I 
hosted my first event - after which I rotated with Bonnie and Tim, 
and Karen and David Miodowski. Karen died in December 2012, so Bonnie 
and Tim, and I, now share responsibility for keeping the group going.
</p>

<p>A historic listing of recent events (2007 tp present) can be found 
on this site at <a href="../past.html"><b>Musica Donavania Past 
Events</b></a>. This listing includes links to many photos, playlists 
and recipes for dishes served. Now, in March 2017, the list has been 
extended to include events from 1961 through 2018, many with photos.</p>

<p>In late 2016 I acquired over 950 CDs of the Jon Stringer music 
collection from his wife, Marge Stringer, and in mid 2017 I acquired 
the remainder, for a total of about 1600 CDs. She said she sold about 
a thousand in her Amazon store, but she tended to greatly overestimate 
numbers, so I do not know.</p>

<p>In honor of its earliest history, on 31 January 2017, I suggested 
Music Group be renamed to <b>Musica Donavania</b>. This name change was 
approved by all members with knowledge of the group's history.</p>
