<b>Good News:</b> &nbsp; After a period of dormancy, following the 
death of the last of the three founders, CES is now back with a 
new Web site and a new plan for practicing and teaching the Ancient 
Egyptian Religion (Kemetism, Egyptian Neopaganism) which should carry 
it farther and to more people than in previous years. Here's the new 
<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/churcheternalsource/">
<b>Church of the Eternal Source</b></a> Web site.</big></p>

<p><big>I am hoping they will be able to restore some of the material 
from the old Web site. It included photos and information that should 
not be lost, especially the fabulous work done on personal temples and 
replica Egyptian artifacts. In particular the Temple of Horus (Harold 
Moss aka Paul Shoemaker) and the Temple of Thoth (Donald Harrison).
