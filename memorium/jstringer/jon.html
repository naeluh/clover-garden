<h1>Jon Martin Stringer</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p><span class=bg>
Jon Stringer was a very well liked person. He taught Health and Science 
at Stephen White Junior High for 30 years. He also, for many years 
(1964 to 2000) organized the music programs for  
<a href="../../music/index.html"><b>Musica Donavania</b></a>. The music 
for these programs was drawn from his rather massive collection of CDs.
</span></p>
<p><span class=bg>
Music, particularly early music (Medieval into Classical) was one 
of Jon's major interests and he was always willing to share his 
expertise.  Other strong interests were film noir, narrow gage steam 
railroads and the old Los Angeles Red Car trolleys.
</span></p>
<p><span class=bg>
I am now curator of the greater part of his very fine collection. More 
than 1600 CDs remain in the collection, each logged with a date for 
every time it was played, and with play time noted for some when it was 
not provided by the publisher. After his stroke in 2000, Jon and Marge 
founded and ran a business importing CDs with the music of Medieval 
Spain: Christian, Muslim and Sephardic.
</span></p>
<p><span class=bg>
Jon was born in 1938, son of Clarence and Margaret McKay 
Stringer. He was married to Marjorie Freeman Stringer for most of his 
adult life, and they had one daughter, Cynthia Heather Stringer. Jon 
suffered a severe stroke in 2000, from which he bravely and consistently 
worked hard to recover from before his death. He died on October 15th, 
2007. </span></p>
