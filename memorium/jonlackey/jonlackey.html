<h1>Jon Lackey</h1>
<hr class=hr2>

<p><span class=bg>Jon Alan Lackey was a tall, gaunt, and imposing man, 
born in 1938, died in 2007. He possessed a certain charisma, which 
affected people, some moderately, and some greatly. This charisma 
attracted many people to him, though it could wear thin if they got 
too close.
</span></p>

<p>There is no question that Jon was an artist, and an artist of 
talent, ability, and great imagination. He was also an artist of 
ambition and grandiose dreams. He aspired to the image of the 
"Renaissance Man", skilled in all the arts and sciences, and all 
aspects of culture. This is the image he sought to project, and did 
so with some success.</p>

<p>A major factor in Jon's life was tea. He was a great promoter of 
tea drinking, and drank it incessantly himself. He depended on it 
to keep very late hours and maintain long conversations. Tea causes 
the mind to race ahead with grandiose plans, but sleep deprivation 
will work against you. One must also wonder if excessive tea drinking 
resulted in his kidney cancer.</p>

<p>Jon's ambitions were great, but often thwarted by some very severe 
personality defects. He had an overwhelming need to be the center of 
the universe, all others were bit players on the stage of his life. He 
needed talented help with his grandiose projects, but people quickly 
learned that he would take all credit, claim all ideas as his, and all 
work as his own, offering no thanks or acknowledgement to others.<p>

<p>In truth, this was the Renaissance mode, and prevailed even beyond 
the American Civil War into the early 20th century. The owner of the 
studio (or laboratory) took all credit, and supporting staff remained 
nameless and unrewarded. This is how Edison got in trouble with a 
vengeful Tesla, and lost his electrical monopoly. Problem: in the late 
20th century, and now in the 21st century, supporting cast demand the 
credit they deserve, or you suffer the consequences. Jon chose the 
consequences.</p>

<p>Here is presented testimony by several persons with very different 
outlooks on their relationship with Jon Lackey. I act as commentator, 
until my own testimony at the end of this piece (followed by anyone 
who wishes to comment on my testimony).</p><br>

<h2>Testimony - Bon Callahan</h2>

<p><img src="img/1305mg10c.jpg" alt="Bon Callhan 2013" class=mrg>
1970: &nbsp; I, a member of the Mythopoeic Society, joined Glen 
Goodknight in his visiting of homes which would welcome our outreach 
charter meetings - new buds of the Mythopoeic growths: Glen's proudly 
emerging discussion groups, branches from his treelet</p>

<p>At the home of Chris Barczak, we meet a clowder of eager readers, 
freshly present. Glen arrived to preside,I at his side. Jon, so very 
tall, so very self possessed, so thespian, much history at his back,  
will serve as our moderator, maven, manager.</p>

<p>Much more magic to come. We created, danced, recited, learned,
under his purview in an empty warehouse filled with vinyl encoded with 
rare music.</p>

<p>Not all went well, we drifted apart by 1976</p>

<p>1986: &nbsp; Later reunited, I learned so much more from his world 
to mine. He had kept sharing with everyone except himself, a monk in 
his own world of fine tea and chaos. Mildly broke his arse, but not a 
sweat, to share so very much with us plebeian witnesses, paradox of 
selfish giving.</p>

<p>He was on the graphics team that designed Irwindale. He strove to 
enter Hollywood - his Creeping Terror construct was ripped off, a 
travesty left to rot on the back porch of monster filmography - must 
have sucked.</p>

<p>2006: &nbsp; Jon fell direly ill, would not admit it, so like him. 
My sisters of choice who had joined his circle, both therapists knew 
the ropes, said to send a social worker to him. After the stonewalling, 
the stones tumbled. He was hospitalized with terminal kidney cancer - 
no family there to assist. Only 69, had many years to live and give
above and beyond the darker traits.</p>

<p>We tried to guide him to his leaving of this world, deserving or not, 
we were all he had for the final drawing of the curtain.</p>

<p>later found remaining family, we were shut out.</p>

<p>He was clayfooted, no idol, giving yet not, enigma of a human. Jon 
hurt allies, lovers, friends, affirmed opinions of enemies - but left 
a powerful presence on all points of the human compass.</p>

<h3>Comment - Andrew Grygus</h3>

<p>Bon's paragraph mentioning <i>The Creeping Terror</i> deserves 
considerable expansion and elucidation. This I provide on the page 
<a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/memorium/jonlackey/creepterror.html"><b>The Creeping Terror</b></a>.</p>

<h2>Testimony - Tim Callahan</h2>

<p><img src="img/1312mg11c.jpg" alt="Tim Callhan 2013" class=mrg>
Jon, one of the earliest members of the "Chesley Donovan Foundation" 
was a person of maddening eccentricities. Despite being a brilliant 
artist and one of the designers of the city of Irvine, California, he 
lived much of his life, and finally died in a state of poverty. To some 
degree he seemed to cherish a "starving artist" lifestyle.</p>

<p>Jon also seemed to have a sense of entitlement, and left this world 
owing many people considerable amounts of back rent. He did pay the 
Callahans with sculptures they collected when he died. These works 
remain an exquisite testimony to his artistic brilliance.</p>

<p>Jon had an excessive need to control the "Music Group". As an example 
of this, on one occasion, when the Callahans were hosting the music 
gathering in the winter, even though much weakened, he completely undid 
and re-laid the fire Tim Callahan had already effectively laid.</p>

<p>Another aspect of his need to control the group was his penchant for 
turning the volume of the music being played up to a point that it hurt 
one's ears in order to force idle conversations to cease.</p>

<p>His need to control and dominate relationships ruined his 
relationship with Katrelya Angus, whom he deliberately estranged by 
comparing her unfavorably with two women of his acquaintance with whom 
he claimed to have had previous liaisons. In fact, these affairs were 
entirely fictional. The two women in question had been friends of his 
but never lovers.</p>

<p>He also bore what seems to have been a totally unreasonable animus 
toward Andrew Grygus, whom he banned from the music gatherings for 
several years.	</p>

<h3>Comment - Andrew Grygus</h3>

<p>That banishment was for about 30 years. The whole silly story can be 
found here: 
<a href="../ajg/banished.html">
<b>Banished  from CD</b></a>. Jon jealously guarded the invitation 
list, but I still attended a few events, invited by Tom Slover and 
Peggy Myron when they were in town.</p>

<hr class=hr2s>
<br>

<h2>Testimony - Mallory &amp; McCall</h2>

<p><img src="img/jm1301b17c.jpg" alt="Mallory &amp; McCall 2013" class=mrg>
This was an actual published obituary, so it's a bit whitewashed. 
<i>Mallory &amp; McCall</i> were for some time hosting Music Group 
events, at least one of which I attended. They told me years later that 
they had stopped hosting because they felt Jon was just using them, 
without credit or appreciation.</p>

<h3>Jon Lackey</h3>
<br><b>Memorial to a true Renaissance Man.  1937-2007</b>

<p>To those of you who were fairegoers or SCA members in the last 30 
or so years in Southern California area, you may well recall the tall, 
slender, imposing figure of Jon Lackey, musician (recorder and wire 
strung Irish harp at the faires), artist, street theater and court 
pageantry innovator, director, photographer and long time friend to 
<i>Mallory &amp; McCall</i>.</p>

<p>Jon died of cancer on February 26, 2007. 	A free spirit who lived out 
of the mainstream, he refused help until the very end, not really 
realizing or admitting how sick he was. He died in his sleep.</p>

<p>Jon was an early member of the Chesley Donovan Foundation. He 
branched from it to form a group dedicated to early and "classical" 
music. They continue to meet, now under the direction of Bonnie Callahan, 
in various member's homes, listen to recorded music of a selected 
composer and enjoy intelligent conversation. Who will forget the respect 
Jon taught us for the correct brewing of exotic teas? The many people 
that he mentored in numerous ways through the years have long respected 
and appreciated his care.</p>

<p>Jon often played recorder with <i>Mallory &amp; McCall</i> during our 
Renaissance, Irish, and even Pirate incarnations, although he was a 
rebel, but not a pirate at heart. He helped stage our fantasy wedding 
in the early 1970s when the very idea was new to us and all our friends. 
He acted with our Janus Company Radio Theater on KPFK in Los Angeles, as 
well, on and off for over 14 years. He also wrote an article and did many 
of the photographs for our book published by Mel Bay, <i>Exploring the 
Folk Harp</i>.</p>

<p>Many recall the events he staged for the Mythopoeic Society. When 
we staged hand hosted several of the Witchcraft and Sorcery Magazine 
Convention's "Queen Witch and King Sorcery" contests in the early '70s, 
he'd cheerfully hide for hours in his fiberglass coffin, to rise up on 
cue, terrorizing the hotel management with his smoke effect! If only...
</p>

<p>To his amusement, he is probably best known for having created the 
monster for the D horror flick "The Creeping Terror", a cult classic. 
He also made several appearances on the old "Steve Allen Show" when it 
was on Vine Street in Hollywood, usually playing some kind of crazy 
expert on torture devices.</p>

<p>Jon was a man of multitude talents. His vast creativity, intelligence, 
and most of all, hose friendship will be sorely missed.</p>

<h2>Testimony - Andrew Grygus</h2>

<p><img src="img/ajghair05c.jpg" alt="Andrew Grygus 2020" class=mrg>
Jon was an artist of talent, a very intelligent, intellectual, and 
well read person, and a person of great ambitions. He also had some very 
severe personality flaws which subverted his ambitions.</p>

<p>Jon could have benefited greatly from what the Witches call "Shadow 
Work", an intensive exploration of your own being, specifically 
the negative features, failings, and hurtfulness to others, with the 
objective of resolution. Many Witches call upon goddess Hekate (say 
Hekatee) with her torches to bring light to this darkness. I assure you, 
Jon would never imagine calling upon a goddess for help, and, 
unfortunately, he considered what others saw as flaws to be "features, 
not bugs".</p>

<p>I met Jon around 1959, though the exact sequence of introductions 
I don't currently remember. At this time he lived in the rooms above the 
Elysian Theater on Riverside Drive in Los Angeles. The theater had been 
long closed. The main theater part was stripped of its seating and used 
by some war surplus outfit to store piles of stuff they weren't really 
able to sell. We referred to it as "The Mine".</p>

<p>I was five years younger than Jon, and considered him a friend, though 
I always kept him at some distance. He would often come around to the 
apartments in Burbank, where I lived with my mother and younger (by 
about 1-1/2 years) brother, Ron.</p>

<p>At the time, Jon drove a Jeep of the WWII surplus sort. He was 
very tall, very thin, and wore his hair and beard exactly like in the 
portraits of Jesus that hung in every elementary school classroom in 
those days. His speech had an odd cadence, with pauses and bursts 
and frequent "uums" and "errs". Ron was certainly not one taken by 
Jon's developing charisma - his name for Jon was "The Jesus Jeep Creep".
</p>

<p>Jon was a very early member of the Chesley Donavan Foundation, but 
not a founder. He came in some time after Paul Shoemaker arrived. 
Certainly he must have contributed some to the legends of the 
Donavanians, but the light hearted humor and casual absurdity of those 
stories conflicted with Jon's tendencies to seriousness and solemnity. 
These attitudes were in keeping with Ron Cobb and Paul Shoemaker, who 
continued writing on the subject many years later, but the stories were 
not much mentioned by Jon during my membership.</p> 

<p>When I first became involved with the Foundation, it was holding 
meetings in Helen Urban's garage, and connections with Science Fiction 
fandom were still quite clear. Ron Cobb was no longer attending, nor was 
Tad Duke. The organization was run by Paul Shoemaker (later known also 
as Harold Moss), Jon Lackey, and Helen Urban. Helen was not in good 
health, so the meetings were soon moved into Jon Lackey's digs. By this 
time, the group's involvement in Science Fiction fandom had seriously 
faded.</p>

<p>Jon supported himself during most of his life with temporary jobs 
involving drafting, illustrating and technical writing, but was most 
of the time unemployed and impoverished.  Years before, he had studied 
at the then famous Chouinard Art Institute, but I don't think he 
graduated. It matters little, what he was learning then was going 
obsolete even as he studied, but Jon adapted the skills to other uses.
</p>

<p>Aside from massive amounts of tea, Jon survived on rice. He would 
boil it with a lot of spices so it was practically a rice curry. It 
wasn't bad, but I never saw him cook anything else. He also had a 
huge jar of honey, which he had stolen from a cafeteria somewhere. 
He didn't use much of it, but put it out for guests. It was so old the 
honey was black. I would tell people it was honey made by bees from 
the flowers of the asphalt plant.</p>

<p>Jon was already a hoarder. His hoarding was enhanced by the fact that 
he considered anything that was not watched or locked down after 1 AM  
to be his. He had thus acquired a lot of "useful" stuff, including 5 or 
6 large cardboard cylinders of a black tar-like substance. These 
followed him through several moves, but he never found a use for them.
</p>

<p>There was also the Atzanzi, a large construction of chicken wire and 
hemp fiber that the CD folks had brought to a Science Fiction convention 
some years before. By my time, participation in Science Fiction fandom 
was long in the past, but the Atzanzi was still there, gathering dust.
</p>

<p>I am very familiar with Jon's growing hoard, because every once in 
a while I had to help him move it from one place to another. It was 
incredible how far behind on rent his landlords allowed him to get 
before they finally demanded he leave - that charisma thing again.</p>

<p>There were a lot of moves. From the theater, it was to a run-down 
industrial building, then to an abandoned church, then to an abandoned 
drug store, then to various homes in run-down neighborhoods. He was 
often stealing water from neighbors because his utilities were turned 
off.</p>

<p>In any case, wherever he was, Jon held weekly CD get togethers, which 
were slowly evolving into what he eventually called "The Music 
Group".</p>

<p>At the time Jon was living in the abandoned church, Jackie became 
his girlfriend. She was a lot younger than he. They probably met 
through her parents, who were quite under the spell of Jon's charisma. 
I overheard them saying it was so nice that their daughter had taken 
up with someone they completely approved of - but Jackie soon left 
for college.</p>

<p>On a day when I and Ron Myron were visiting Jon, he was using the 
typewriter. He said he was writing a letter to Jackie. Ron and I both 
agreed, and suggested to Jon that in writing to a girlfriend, 
handwriting would be more appropriate than a typewriter.</p>

<p>Jon reacted to this suggestion with such outrage that Ron and I 
immediately left his home. This was a turning point. Going forward, 
Jon now treated us both with open disdain, rather than his customary 
condescension. Ron had already drifted away from the CD group, but 
I continued to attended meetings until my banishment. I no longer 
visited Jon outside these events. Jackie died of medical 
complications a few months after this event.</p>

<p>Around 1970 Jon became involved with the Mythopoeic Society, and 
this is described in Testimonies above. As an associate of Jon's with 
some technical skills, I became involved with some activities, though 
I was very peripheral to the group and never attended any of their 
literary discussions. I was, however, involved in one of Jon's early 
stage productions with the group, <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/memorium/jonlackey/grtrumps.html">
<b>The Greater Trumps</b></a>. It did not go so well, and I never became 
involved with any of Jon's further projects.</p> 

<p>Jon also liked to organize camping trips, particularly to Calico 
and Red Rock Canyon. These were usually timed by the astronomical dates 
of Perihelion and Aphelion, which had been established by Paul Shoemaker 
for mock religious ceremonies. Jon was a hard core atheist, and the 
Pagan revival had yet to begin in earnest, so everyone accepted this 
mockery. Paul eventually became a serious priest of the Khemetic 
(ancient Egyptian) religion and a founder of the Church of the 
Eternal Source.</p>

<p>Jon increasingly considered me to be a threat to his total dominance 
of the group, now that Paul and Helen were both gone. I had fomented a 
couple of revolts within the CD organization, and a lot of attendees were 
friends of mine. He missed no opportunity to denigrate me as totally 
devoid of artistic, musical, or literary talent or ability.</p>

<p>When I built my concrete boat, I had a bunch of people over, including 
Jon, to help me turn the hull upright. I heard Jon tell people looking 
at the hull, "How could <u>he</u> create something with such beautiful 
curves".</p>

<p>I continued to attend CD meetings and some of Jon's events, until the 
fateful day, probably in 1973, when it all blew up, when I hurt Jon's 
tender ego beyond his ability to tolerate. This story is explained in 
detail on the page 
<a href="../ajg/banished.html">
<b>Banished from CD</b></a>. People tend to presume this banishment 
caused me to have considerable animosity toward Jon, but this is not 
actually the case. I had plenty else to do in those days.</p>

<p>After banishment, I still attended a few Music Group events. When 
Tom and Peggy were in town from their world traveling, they would 
invite me along, as they were still on Jon's list. Jon couldn't throw 
me out, because they were now always at someone else's home. He couldn't 
host because it's hard to hold a recorded music event when all your 
utilities are turned off. I was always cordial, and he was always 
"Haruuumph!".</p>

<p>During this time, people were giving Jon commissions for artwork, 
just to keep him alive, and not because they actually expected delivery. 
Jon's artworks always needed "just a little more work" before he was 
satisfied they were done. Often they were barely started, then 
abandoned for years.</p>

<p>When his parents died, Jon inherited enough money for a trip to 
England. I think Tom and Peggy were there at the time. This was a very 
important trip for Jon, due to his enthusiasm for the Tolkein stories, 
early English, Irish, and Scottish music, and English Renaissance 
re-enactments</p>

<p>There was also the "Katrelia matter". I had met Katrelia once at a 
Music Group event at Mallory &amp; McCall's, but the relationship between 
Jon and Katrelia happened during my long banishment. When I returned to 
the group, Katrelia was still seriously on the outs with Bon and Tim for 
encouraging her to get into the relationship. I don't remember how we got 
in contact, but she considered me to be another of Jon's victims. Jon 
never had enough leverage over me to make me a victim, but having this 
association with Katrelia made it possible for me to aid in getting her 
reconciled with Bon and Tim.<p>

<p>Interestingly, in Jon's writings, apparently in 1973, there are 
two pages listing all the qualities desired of a woman to be his 
companion. Katrelia fit that specification like it was written for 
her. There was also another page, dated Mar 1973, titled "How to 
Please a Woman".</p>

<p>It is ironic that when the woman came along, Jon's personality made 
it totally impossible for him to handle the situation. He simply could 
not share authority within his household with another person. While 
Katrelia remained devoted to Jon, he soon became mentally abusive. He 
told Dana Downy he really needed to drive her away. Finally he became 
physically abusive, causing injury, and that is when she left. She 
still holds considerable bitterness toward Jon for the disruption 
he caused in her life.</p>

<p>Jon died of kidney cancer in February of 2007. Within a few weeks 
I was invited back to the CD / Music Group events. I did not know the 
people attending at that time, except Lee Winters, whom I had introduced 
to the group in the late 1960's. I presume Tom and Peggy told Bon to 
invite me. The first event I attended was 17 March 2007, and the first 
event I hosted was April 2007.</p>

<p><b>A Final Note:</b> &nbsp; I have been composing the history of 
the Chesley Donavan Foundation and the Music Group. I got agreement 
with the most senior members to rename the group Musica Donavania, 
in honor of it's origins. The Musica Donavania pages have been 
incorporated into my Clovegarden.com Website. See 
<a href="../../music/ancient/index.html">
<b>History of Musica Donavania</b></a> and also 
<a href="../../music/past.html">
<b>Musica Donavania Past Events</b></a> which has a lot of photos 
taken at events.</p>

<p>If there is consciousness after death, Jon's ashes should be 
smoldering over how so much of his legacy now depends on the hated Me 
for continuation. Actually, he wouldn't notice. He was such a committed 
atheist materialist, he'd still be busy denying there was consciousness 
after death.</p>
