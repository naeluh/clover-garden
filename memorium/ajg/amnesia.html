This event in my life occurred around 1970, I'll post the correct 
date when I can find it. At this time I worked at Bell &amp; Howell 
Electronic Instrument Division, and drove an XK120 Jaguar roadster. The 
one in the photo is not mine, but the same exact model. This is an 
absolutely true story, with not a phrase or fragment made up or filled 
in.</span>

<p>It was a Sunday, and I'd spent the afternoon at the home of 
Bob Barnes and Louis Rivera, attending the weekly music get together 
they hosted. I departed early, because I was scheduled to take Wendy 
Wilmes out to dinner. It was during the late autumn or early winter, 
so darkness fell early.</p>

<p>Heading to the home of Wendy and her mother Mary Halcrow, I missed 
my turn, and the street I was on ended in a dirt area a hundred yards 
or so farther. There were many tracks in the dirt from vehicles that 
had turned around there, and I continued on to do the same. In the 
darkness I did not see there was a rusty chain stretched across the 
end of the street, with no sign or safety banners.</p>

<p>The chain snapped up over the front of my car and started climbing 
the windshield. I ducked, and fortunately the XK120 had cut down doors, 
so the chain, rather than decapitating me, slapped me across the face, 
yanking my head back.</p>

<p>Somehow, I was able to turn around and took the right turn, stopping 
at the right house. Wendy and her mother Mary were there, and they could 
see that I was injured. I asked them why I was there, and they told me 
I was supposed to take Wendy out for dinner. At this point my memory 
spanned less than 10 minutes, so I kept going out to see if the car was 
damaged (it had no significant damage) and to try to figure out just 
what had happened. How I got the car back out under that chain, I have 
no memory of.</p>

<p>They got hold of my mother, possibly from information in my wallet. 
They also went to the scene of the accident and retrieved my glasses 
which had been knocked off (I was near sighted in those days).</p>

<p>My mother took me to Adventist Hospital, which was close. There, in 
the emergency room, they had a look at me and told my mother to take me 
home, and if I hadn't improved by morning, to either bring me back, or 
take me to St. Joseph's in Burbank. They said the same neurosurgeon 
worked in both hospitals and would have a look at me. I have only an 
extremely vague memory from that visit, and only of the inside of the 
parking structure.</p>

<p>In the morning, I still had no long term memory, so my mother took 
me to St. Joseph's, because that's where she always took my brother Ron 
for motorcycle accidents. We went into a receiving area.

<p>From the neurosurgeon event, I clearly remembered two things. One 
was the little triangular brown rubber hammer he hit my knee with to 
test my reflexes. The other was that he'd apparently just read about 
an unusual spinal disease that he was sure had caused me to black out 
and have the accident. I had some impression of what had happened, and 
protested, but he couldn't be convinced. He told my mother he would 
do a spinal tap to detect the disease.</p>

<p>My mother went around to the front office to handle the paperwork. 
Meanwhile, I was just sitting on a gurney and nobody was paying any 
attention to me. I had become convinced this neurosurgeon was a 
real nut case, and that a spinal tap didn't sound real comfortable. 
I picked up my jacket and headed for the door. It was an automatic 
door and opened helpfully.</p>

<p>Meanwhile my mother answered all the questions for the receptionist, 
who finally said she had just about everything. Then she said, "Oh, one 
more thing. Is he Catholic?" My mother answered "No.". The receptionist 
asked, "What church does he attended?". My mother told her the last one 
I had attended was Methodist. So the receptionist entered "Methodist" 
and filled out some more stuff.</p>

<p>The receptionist thought for a moment, then asked, "Has he been 
baptized?". My mother answered, "Yes, in fact he was christened in 
St. Ann's Cathedral in New York City. The receptionist suddenly 
brightened up, saying, "Oh! He's Catholic then!", and started erasing 
things from the form and making new entries. My mother headed off 
to work.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I was on my way. Buena Vista, a major street in Burbank, 
looked sort of familiar, and went the way I thought I wanted to go, 
but I decided to take a small parallel street so they couldn't find 
me when they came looking for me.</p> 

<p>I walked a few blocks, and encountered a guy working in the engine 
compartment of a black Jaguar sedan (one of the larger ones). I stopped 
and talked briefly, giving him some suggestions about the engine (which 
I was very familiar with), and headed on my way.</p>

<p>So, I walked diagonally all the way across Burbank to Sun Valley. 
As I went I compared features that I saw with features that were slowly 
seeping back from my memory, seriously trying to determine if I was now 
still in the same world as I had been before. Things seemed to match, 
except what I thought should be San Fernando Road, was signed San 
Fernando Blvd. This did give me a touch of concern.</p>
 
<p>I finally got to Sun Valley where I found my mother's place. Things 
were looking more and more familiar, so I raided the refrigerator, then 
headed for my place, a converted migrant farm worker's cottage a mile 
and a half away, 10519-1/4 La Tuna Canyon Road. My key fit the lock, so 
I went in and took a short nap. Then I started making phone calls to 
friends.</p>

<p>At about 2:30 in the afternoon, I got a call from the hospital, 
asking if I knew where Andrew Grygus was. I answered, "Speaking". The 
person said "What?" I said "Speaking, this is me, Andrew Grygus". "Oh", 
she said, "What happened to you?" I told her nobody was paying attention 
to me, so I left. She told me that in this case, the hospital couldn't 
be responsible for my condition. I told her I was just fine with that.
</p>

<p>Meanwhile, my mother was also making phone calls. She found out, 
probably from Mary, that I'd been coming from Bob and Lou's, and got 
their phone number. She got through to Bob, described the situation, 
and asked him if I had been drinking. Bob responded, "Well, yes, of 
course, but not that much, and he was in good shape when he left".<p>

<p>Then Bob said, "Well, anyway, I'm glad he's getting better". My 
mother said, "He's in the hospital, you know". Bob replied "Oh no he's 
not". So then I got a call from my mother.</p>

<p>Monday I called in to Bell &amp; Howell and told them I was taking 
two days off for recovery. I gave them a brief description of events. 
The word spread quickly, to all the engineers and office workers, that 
I had walked all the way across Burbank in a hospital gown. I saw no 
reason whatever to correct them on this matter.</p>

<p>I tried to contact the neurosurgeon, but he was so offended that I'd 
escaped from him he wouldn't speak to me. He did send a bill, though.</p>
