This essay was first published on the discussion board IWeThey, thus 
the slightly odd lead-in remark about English teachers and Editors. 
Comment had been made about my including quotes by more than one person 
in a single paragraph in my Amnesia essay, "which most editors (and high 
school English teachers) would take issue with".

<p>I have had "issues" with English teachers since well before high school, 
and very much so with Miss Weinstock in senior year high. I did not and 
will not yield. Editors? I don't give a shit about them, nor they about 
me.</p>

<p>Miss Weinstock, terror of Burbank High. had two example students, my 
almost girl friend Karen Lynn<a href="graduation.html#kl">**</a>, and myself. We were 
not in the same classes.</p>

<p>Miss Weinstock (Ms. had not been invented yet) told everyone how 
wonderful Karen Lynn was, who had never had a grade less than "A" 
(except in PE, she was very small). She compared her to 
"<u>Andrew Grygus</u>" (emphasis hers), who is <u>just as smart</u> and 
could get grades just as good, but <u>will not apply himself</u>!"</p>

<p>Actually, I was applying myself vigorously to my studies, which just 
didn't happen to coincide with the studies assigned me by teachers.</p>

<p>By the last semester, Karen had already effectively graduated, been 
accepted into college, and sluffed off, skipping classes, etc. No 
further "As" were needed.</p>

<p>Funny: after graduation, Karen admitted to hating Miss Weinstock's 
guts, whereas I, who had fought her constantly, thought she was pretty 
OK. I guess "As" can be expensive to the soul.</p>

<p>Added note: At graduation Karen was on the honors stage . . . . . . . 
. and so was I. Teachers asked each other, "What the Hell is <u>he</u> 
doing up there?" Well, it was the SAT. Karen had missed 1 question, I 
had missed 3. Note: in those days there was not SAT tutoring, we had 
to fly solo.</p>

<p>Actually I almost didn't graduate - well, not all that close. In my 
"Senior Psychology" class, taught by Mr Brukner, the PE coach, we were 
required to produce a Daily Diary of the class. Some hopeless nerd 
actually did that, and most of the rest copied him. This was a severe 
violation of my ethical standards, I wouldn't copy, and I wouldn't do 
something so stupid. When the time came to turn it in, I presented 
nothing, and explained why. Mr Brukner flagged me as disobedient, 
disruptive, failed, and not to graduate.</p>

<p>I was called before Mr. Ed Bedigan, the Principal, to explain myself. 
I did. He said, "Well, let us see". He pulled out my folder and opened 
it. It contained not even a moth. He said to me, "You mean you have gone 
all they way through high school and never been in any kind of trouble 
at all?" I told him, "Not that I recall". He closed the folder and said, 
"You're graduating".</p>

<p id="kl"><b>**</b> Karen and her family were staunch Mormons, and 
tried to convert me. Even though I still presumed I was a Christian 
in those days, I knew this could not possibly work. The angel Moron 
(oops, that's Moroni, he's Italian) and I were not going to get along. 
A few years ago I remembered her married name and looked her up on 
the Internet. She teaches early Mormon music at Brigham Young in 
Utah.</p>

<p>The greatest tragedy of my relationship with Miss Weinstock is that 
I was not yet familiar with the writings of Ambrose Bierce, particularly 
his <i>Cynic's Word Book</i> (later called <i>The Devil's 
Dictionary</i>). 

<p>I had written an essay and used the word "undoubtably". She marked 
me down for using an "obsolescent" word. What I meant to say was that 
it "could not be doubted", not that it "wasn't doubted". This pissed 
me off, but she would not relent. Here's what Ambrose Bierce has to 
say: 
<blockquote><b>Obsolete</b>, <i>adj.</i> No longer used by the timid. 
Said chiefly of words. A word which some lexicographer has marked 
obsolete is ever thereafter an object of dread and loathing to the fool 
writer, but if it is a good word and no exact modern equivalent equally 
good, it is good enough for the good writer. Indeed, a writer's attitude 
toward "obsolete" words is as true a measure of his literary ability as 
anything except the character of his work. . . </blockquote>
