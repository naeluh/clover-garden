<h1>Extra Terrestrial Intelligence</h1>
<br><img src="img/blkhole01h.jpg" alt="Black Hole" class=mrg>

<p>Much time and money has been expended on attempts to detect 
intelligent life beyond our solar system. Science fiction fans and many 
scientists in the technical fields are quite disappointed that no signals 
have been detected, when there may be a billion habitable planets in 
the galaxy.</p>
 
<p>A popular explanation is that it could be due to the short span 
of broadcast technology. Broadcasting has only been significant for us 
for about 100 years, and is already being replaced by much more efficient 
fiber networks. This is a very short window.  Remaining transmission 
sources tend to be highly directional and of lower power, allowed by 
their highly directional nature.</p>

<p>Evolutionary scientists have a different take, and are pretty sure 
the time and money expended on detecting ET was poured into a Black 
Hole (see photo).</p>

<p>Most people think of evolution as continuous, orderly, and inevitable. 
In fact, we are the result of a chain of extremely unlikely events, each  
happening suddenly, and widely spaced in time. There may be other intelligent 
life in our galaxy, but it would have developed from an entirely different 
chain of unlikely events and may be so different we wouldn't even recognize 
it as intelligence.</p>

<p><b>But now we know it's even worse!</b> &nbsp; It had been presumed 
there are a billion or more Earth-like planets in our galaxy that could 
support life. The <a href="etintel.html#nice"><b>"Nice Model"</b></a>, and other 
research by planetary physicists on formation of our solar system, suggests 
there are probably far fewer.

<p>Life itself seems highly likely. It took only a half billion years 
from the formation of our planet for life to appear in it's seas. 
Beyond that, the evolution leading to us is extremely unlikely. Here is 
a listing of known unlikely events that made us possible. Surely there 
are other more subtle ones.</p>

<h3>Two Lines of Life:</h3> &nbsp; Not one, but two surviving lines 
originated from Luca (Last Universal Common Ancestor): Bacteria and 
Archaea. Archaea are quite different from Bacteria, but they look so 
alike they were thought to be Bacteria until 1977. They were at first 
thought to only reside in marginal environments, such as undersea 
volcanic vents. Now it is known about half of what we thought to be 
Bacteria are actually Archaea. The importance of two lines will be 
found below - but what are the odds of having two lines? Impossible 
to calculate.<p></p>

<h3>Cyanobacteria:</h3> &nbsp; Cyanobacteria invented Photosynthesis, 
using solar energy to break up Carbon Dioxide and use the Carbon to 
grow more Cyanobacteria. This was highly successful, but Oxygen was 
a waste product. Cyanobacteria are the sole source of Oxygen in our 
atmosphere. Plant Chloroplasts are all evolved from Cyanobacteria. 
What are the odds? Pretty slim, this took 3/4 of a billion years, 
and has happened exactly once in 4-1/4 billion years.<p></p>

<h3>Extinction:</h3> &nbsp; Cyanobacteria were highly successful, and 
the Oxygen they emitted caused the period of one billion years known as 
"The Great Rust". Eventually there was nothing left to rust, and free 
Oxygen started building up in the atmosphere. Life on Earth was nearly 
extinguished when the atmosphere switched from being reducing to being 
oxidizing. Only a few forms, those already accustomed to very marginal 
environments, survived to repopulate the Earth. The chances of survival?  
Impossible to calculate.<p></p>

<h3>Eukaryots:</h3> &nbsp; Here is the importance of there being two 
lines of life, and one of the most absurdly unlikely happenings in 
our evolution. Some Archaea got it's DNA tangled up with some Bacterial 
DNA. This caused it to go totally bonkers, growing to enormous size, 
around 50,000 times the volume of a bacteria.  This chimera, known 
as a Eukaryot, continued absorbing more bacterial DNA from other 
sources. What are the odds? It took 2-1/4 billion years to happen, and 
it has happened only once in 4-1/4 billion 
years. Very thin odds.<p></p>

<h3>Infection:</h3> &nbsp; Some form of Eubacteria was engulfed by a 
Eukaryot, but was not absorbed as food, nor did it cause a deadly 
infection. This bacterium took up permanent residence, maintaining it's 
own DNA, as it still does to this day. In reaction to this, and other 
risks of confusion, the Eukaryots walled off their own DNA with a 
membrane, forming the Cell Nucleus. The invading bacteria was perfectly 
willing to pay rent for this comfortable environment, evolving into the 
Mitochondria, without which high energy life forms would be impossible. 
Among many other functions they now perform, they convert difficult to 
use molecules to forms the Eukaryot cell can much more easily use for 
energy. What are the odds? This has happened exactly once in 4-1/4 
billion years.<p></p>

<h3>Infection #2:</h3>. &nbsp; Some Eukaryote cell, already infected 
with the evolving Mitochondria, became similarly infected with a 
Cyanobacterum.  This bacteria also failed to be digested and took up 
residence, evolving into Chloroplasts, which, like the Mitochondria, 
maintain their own separate DNA. What are the odds? This has happened 
exactly once in 4-1/4 billion years.<p></p>

<p>Now there were two advanced single cell life forms, one producing 
food, the other consuming food. What are the chances?  Multiply the 
chances of existence of Eukaryotes by chances of infection with 
Mitochondria by the chances of infection by Cyanobacteria. We're getting 
awfully close to 0 here, many zeros to the right of the decimal.</p>

<p>OK, this is all simplified, because there are some other fragments 
and remanents of evolution that still exist, but we can ignore them,
unless one causes a disease you suffer from.</p>

<h3>Multicellular Life:</h3> &nbsp;  Both lines of the totally improbable, 
and by now unbelievably complex, Eukaryotes developed multicellular forms, 
with different cells specializing in different functions, thus making 
complex life forms. What are the odds?  Well, we're already so close to 
0 how can you even figure it?<p></p>

<h3>Sexual Reproduction:</h3> &nbsp;  Evolution, which had been painfully 
slow over billions of years, now developed methods of DNA mixing, and 
evolution took off like gangbusters!  What are the odds?  Well it took 3 
billion years to happen, with odds already approaching 0 as a limit.
<p></p>

<h3>Three Lines:</h3> &nbsp; Eukariotes had already split into 2 lines, 
those with Chlorophyll (Plants) which could manufacture their own food, 
and those without, Opisthokonts, which fed on both living and dead life. 
Opisthokonts now split into two lines with very different 
characteristics, Animals and Fungus. Animals developed environmentally 
aware and self mobile entities. What intelligence is inherent in the 
vast network of fungal mycelium is still beyond our knowledge. These 
three lines are of critical importance to each other. The chances? This 
took 3-3/4 billion years to happen, and happened only once in 4-1/4 
billion years. Go figure.<p></p>

<h3>Land Living:</h3> &nbsp; A few lines of Animals learned to live out 
of water. Fortunately, some plants had already learned to live on land, 
so there was enough to eat. For animals, this was very difficult, especially 
in regards to reproduction. Some absurdly complex methods of reproduction 
were developed by the variety we call mammals - so complex it can't possibly 
work, but it does - perhaps sometimes too well. 
<p></p>

<p>OK, now we're down to the last 10 minutes of evolution.</p>

<h3>Extinction:</h3> &nbsp; Could the very evolutionarily advanced 
Dinosaurs become an intelligent life form?  Maybe they did, but we 
don't understand their form of intelligence. Anyway, an asteroid 
hit the Earth on one side, while an incredibly violent volcanic 
event was happening on the other side. Climate and atmosphere were 
severely disrupted, and the non-avian Dinosaurs went extinct (along 
with most other life on Earth). A very few small burrowing mammals 
survived. Lack of competition freed the mammals to dominate the Earth. 
What are the chances of this double disaster? What are the chances that 
we survived when most everything else died?  Not real good in either 
case, but we pulled through.<p></p>

<h3>Tree Living:</h3> &nbsp; A particular line of land mammals evolved 
for living in trees. They developed a form of hands that were able to 
easily manipulate physical objects. Chances here aren't so bad, a few 
other animals are fairly close.<p></p>

<h3>Crossed Wiring:</h3> &nbsp; One variety of these tree living 
critters got their wiring crossed up, with the thinking part of their 
brain connected (weakly) to the pleasure center.  Bored with trees, 
these critters came down, taking up life on the ground, and protecting 
themselves from predators with rocks and sharp sticks.<p></p>

<h3>Fire:</h3> &nbsp;  This one variety, and only this one variety, 
learned how to control fire, which terrified all other animals. With 
it, they learned to cook food. Cooking food greatly expanded the 
available food supply and greatly expanded the nutritional value of 
the food.  This allowed them the luxury of developing large, energy 
expensive brains.<p></p>

<h3>Sleep:</h3> &nbsp; Fire also could be used as protection from large 
predators at night. This security allowed development of a very different 
and very complex sleep pattern. This resulted from the exact structure 
of the mammalian brain, and it gave the ability to organize much larger 
social structures. The various Human species were born, but with only one 
survivor, Homo sapiens.<p></p>

<h3>Timing:</h3> &nbsp; <u>Extremely critical</u>. If any one of the 
earlier steps had taken only 20% longer, we would have missed the 
window of a habitable Earth entirely.<p></p>

<h3>Conclusion:</h3> &nbsp; Intelligent aliens in Science Fiction are 
a lovely form of fantasy, but in reality, extremely unlikely. The chances 
of our own evolution going the way it did are pretty much identical to 0, 
and that's pretty much what we can expect elsewhere.
<p></p>

<h2 id="nice">And, It Gets Even Worse</h2>

<p><img src="img/asteroid02d.jpg" alt="Asteroid Impact" class=mrg>
The "Nice Model", named for the city of Nice in France, is a complex 
model for the formation and evolution of our Solar System. It has been 
refined until it  produces a final result very similar to the physical 
evidence we see.</p>

<p>The Solar system consists of inner and outer zones, separated by the 
"Frost line" ("Snow line", "Ice line"). The rocky planets, Mercury, Venus, 
Earth, and Mars were formed well to the Sun side of the Frost line, which 
was at 2.7 AU (Astronomic Units) from the sun when the planets started forming. 
This is right in the center of the Asteroid Belt today. Earth is at 1 AU, 
and the "Frost line" is now at about 5 AU.</p>

<p>Between the Frost Line and the Sun is a region without water, carbon, or 
organic molecules. Only refractory materials survived in the heat of the Sun. 
Only sterile planets could form inside the Frost Line. The nearside of the 
Asteroid Belt is devoid of water, and the far side is wet.</p>

<p>Outside the "Frost Line" there formed two Gas Giant planets, Jupiter 
and Saturn, and two Ice Giant planets, Uranus and Neptune - and lots and 
lots of "space junk". This region abounds with water and organic compounds, 
including amino acids, the building blocks of life, and metals. We know this 
because pieces still hit the Earth now and then. They have been analyzed in 
detail, and our instruments can detect water in space, confirming there is 
a lot of it out there.</p>

<p>So how did the sterile earth become coated with water, organic molecules, 
and various metals?  The Gas Giant planets had wandering orbits and were 
constantly interacting gravitationally with each other, and also physically 
with the space junk. Asteroids and such were hurled away, some across the 
Frostline where they bombarded the inner planets, including Earth. Earth was 
large enough, and far enough from the Sun to be able to hold on to this 
stuff.</p>

<p>And for intelligent life similar to ours, the metals brought by this 
bombardment are also critical. Our technology has been based on these 
metals since invention of the metal plow, actually earlier if you count 
weapons and jewelry. So how common is this complex interaction of Gas 
Giant and Ice Giant planets with all this space junk?  Without the asteroid 
bombardment there can be no life on inner planets, never mind intelligent 
life. We do not know if this is common in other solar systems.</p>

<p>But, it gets even worse! Jupiters orbit was migrating towards the Sun, but 
due to very complex gravitational interactions among the outer planets and 
space junk, including resonance, it reversed and actually moved farther from 
the Sun. This may be a very unusual thing. Astronomers have discovered many 
"hot Jupiter" solar systems where a huge gas giant is circling its star far 
within the distance where it could have formed - and would have wiped out any 
inner planets that could have hosted life as it migrated inward. The ease with 
which these systems can be found suggests that this is the normal mode, and 
the survival of inner planets is quite unusual.</p>

<p>So, not only do we have the statistical improbabilities of evolution, 
we seem also to have a far smaller base of planets for possibilities to 
develop on, further reducing the probability of intelligent life - so 
don't expect to be having lunch with ET any time soon.</p>

<p><b><i>Asteroids</i></b>, a book by Martin Elvis explains all this in much 
greater detail. Wikipedia has an extensive article on the <i>Nice Model</i>, 
which will be nearly impossible for most people to understand. They also have 
an article on the "Frost line" that is fairly easy to understand.
