This is a phase within a long story, some of which can be found at 
<a href="../../music/ancient/index.html"><b>History of Musica 
Donavania</b></a>, and more will be published on this site as time 
permits. It is the culmination of Jon Lackey's efforts to remove me 
from his life.</span></p>
<p>Jon was an artist of considerable talent and ability. Having studied 
at the then famous Chouinard Art Institute, he considered himself a 
creator of fine art, and had great ambitions. He also had some severe 
personality flaws, which worked seriously against him. His ego required 
he be the center of the world, and he would brook no competition. He 
needed help from others for his more ambitious projects, but would give 
no credit except to himself. He considered me a dangerous competitor in 
his efforts to grasp glory, but strictly as a social competitor, not an 
artistic competitor.

<p>Jon ridiculed me often, especially for total lack of artistic 
sensitivity or ability. When he saw the concrete sail boat I was 
building, I heard him say to others, in a disdainful tone, "How could 
<u>he</u> build something with such beautiful curves". Finally, though, 
the situation turned, and Jon could take my presence no longer. He  
banished me from Chesley Donavan Foundation meetings, which he 
jealously controlled.</p>

<p>In those days, the Chesley Donavan Foundation meetings were held 
every Friday evening at Jon's digs. I had been a member since about 
1960, when meetings were still in Helen Urban's garage. I attended 
almost every meeting. There were usually around 8 people there.</p>

<p>As for my artistic abilities, in my childhood, I drew pictures now 
and then. They were not particularly talented and none have survived to 
the current day, which is no loss. When I was about 30, I made the 
first drawing of my adult life. it was simple, of a primitive nature, 
in pencil, with a fantastical subject.</p>

<p><img src="img/ajgdwg006k.jpg" alt="First Adult Drawing" class=mrg>
I showed this picture to Ron Cob, one of the founders of the Chesley 
Donavan Foundation, but who had not attended meetings since his return 
from the Vietnam war. I met him through friends. By this time he was a 
successful political cartoonist for the Free Press, and a rising talent 
in graphic arts and design. He encouraged me to do more artwork.</p>

<p>I went out and bought a set of colored pencils for my next drawing, 
totally different from the first, but still on a fantastical theme, In 
fact, for the entirety of my short artistic period, I did nothing but 
fantastical themes. For my third drawing, and beyond, I moved to 
Pelican colored inks.</p>

<p>Also among the regular CD meeting attendees was David Cuthbertson, 
art director for a greeting card company. Jon was persistent in trying 
to sell art to David, but David was not buying. Certainly not for 
greeting cards, the style of the time was totally different from 
anything Jon had ever produced, but he was not buying for his private 
collection either.<br class=cll></p>

<p><img src="img/ajgdwg003k.jpg" alt="Pen and Ink Drawing" class=mrg> 
Neither Jon nor any other person attending the CD events had seen any 
of my drawings. I took one, I think it was my 4th finished drawing, to 
a meeting, just to show around. It was in a style and theme similar to 
the drawing shown here on the left. It was passed from hand to hand, 
until it got to David Cuthbertson. He pulled out his checkbook and 
wrote a check for it, at a decent price for a small work by a totally 
unknown artist.</p>

<p>This was just way more than Jon's ego could take. The person whom 
he had so often ridiculed for lack of artistic sensitivity showed up 
with a drawing and sold it to an art director who would not buy any 
of his, <u>in his home</u>. When I showed up for the next meeting, 
Jon rushed to the door, physically turned me around and shoved me 
out, telling me to never come there again.<p>

<p>Well, I had a whole lot of other things that I was doing, so this 
bothered me only moderately, and soon faded way into the background. 
This banishment lasted about 30 years. I was called back a couple of 
weeks after Jon's death, by people who were not members at the time 
I was banished.</p>

<p>The CD meetings had become the "Music Group" meetings, held once 
a month. These meetings were no longer at Jon's place because his 
electricity was usually turned off for non-payment, so playing recorded 
music, especially at the volume he liked, was out of the question.</p>

<p>When Tom and Peggy were in town from their travels around the world, 
they sometimes invited me along to Music Group events. I was very cordial 
to Jon, but he was all "Haruuuumph!" - but he couldn't shove me out of 
other people's homes.</p>
