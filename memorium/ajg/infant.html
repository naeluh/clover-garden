This photo is of myself with my mother, Isobel Burzycki, and father 
Herman Gryguc. It was taken in Alpha, New Jersey, is dated August 27 
1943, so I am 4 months old. We moved from New York to an appartment 
building in Alpha about that time, as my Certificate of Baptism is 
dated August 26th 1943 in New York. The move was because my uncle 
Zigmund moved his company, New York Transformer, to Alpha. I think 
this is the only photo I have of myself with both my mother and 
father. Father was away at work so much of the time.

Here is the hospital birth certificate testifying that I was actually 
born rather than hatched. The legal State of New York Birth Certificate 
has PM instead of AM on the time.

<img src="img/ajg_child005c.jpg" alt="In Washington Park" class=mrg></a>
This photo, taken July 4th in Washington Park, New York City, is one 
I heard about a number of times during my childhood and later. My 
parents wanted to take the picture with a nice background, and my 
mother stepped back onto the grass. She was immediately chased off 
the grass by a policeman. This is a cropped version, click on it to 
see the whole photo. You can see in the full one how harsh my life 
was from the first - my baby carriage has bare iron wheels, not  
plump soft rubber tires like they all do today!

</a>
I was baptized in the National Shrine of Saint Ann in New York City. 
Unfortunately, all that remains is this historic church is the 
bell tower and some of the facade, as it was sold by the Archdiocese 
of New York and demolished to build a college dormatory.
