OK, I confess, I'm not actually dead (2021), and don't expect to be dead 
for some time (despite COVID-19, Murder Hornets, and the Paranoids all 
plotting against me). I'm starting my own memorial page now because I'm 
very confident nobody else would ever get around to it. I can't get them 
to write up pages for people who were actually important in their lives.
</span>
<p><span class=bg>I was born Andrew Joseph Gryguc at St Vincent's Hospital, 
New York, New York, to Herman Gryguc and Isobel Burzycki, at 9:32 on 
30 April 1943. Family announcements and records say AM, and a hospital 
birth certificate says AM, but my legal Birth Certificate says PM. I 
prefer that one because it puts my birth well into  Walpurgisnacht by 
the old reconing (after sundown on 30 April).</span></p>
<p><span class=bg>The family name was later informally changed to Grygus, 
because people sending mail were certain Gryguc had to be wrong and made 
entertaining guesses as to what it must actually be. </span></p>
<p><span class=bg>I have quite a number of past lives. The good thing is, 
I haven't had to die between them, even once. I will add material on them 
and people I've encountered in that travel as time permits. Contributions 
of more information on Andrew Grygus that can be included here are 
welcome.</span></p>
