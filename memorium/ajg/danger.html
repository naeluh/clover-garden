<h1>The Dangers <small>of</small> New Wealth</h1>

This is a story of my long time friends Connie and Stew. Stew was a beach 
bum, but Connie saw he had potential and got pregnant. Stew did the right 
thing and married her, and Connie sent him to work.</span></p>
<p>I met Stew when I got a job as a night production control clerk at 
Valley Bolt, during the height of the aero-space boom. It was during the 
Vietnam War and preparation for the Apollo moon project. He was involved 
in purchasing, and soon left the company to found a metals reselling 
business, in conjunction with some partners. It began in a garage rented 
from an elderly lady, and grew.</p>
<p>Connie and Stew had been able to buy a modest house a little ways up the 
hills over La Crescenta, California. As the business continued to grow, they 
were able to buy a much larger house way up near the top of the hills, and 
the vacant lot next door to it. This house is the scene of our story.

<p>Connie and Stew lived in this new house for years, as their children, 
Ben and Lisa, grew into promising young persons. The business continued to 
be profitable and started provided plenty of available cash for home 
improvements. A large kiln was built for Connie's ceramics ambitions, and 
all was well.</p>

<p>Stew had arranged with an architect to plan an expansion of the house 
into the neighboring lot, but meanwhile improvements to the house in its 
current state were being made. The kitchen in this house was very small, 
compared to the rest of it, and was the only area that had a low ceiling, 
the rest of the house being open ceiling. This kitchen was obviously 
not designed for someone with culinary ambitions.</p>

<p>One of the improvements made was to replace the barely adequate stove 
in the kitchen with a much more powerful Viking gas range. Stew also mounted 
an institutional size fire extinguisher conveniently placed in the kitchen.
</p>

Soon after the new stove was installed, Connie decided to make Swedish 
Rosette cookies. These involve a pot of hot oil and iron molds with a 
long stem, as in the photo to the left <small>(Borrowed from Kitchen 
Craft)</small>.</p>

<p>Connie put the pot of oil on the stove to heat up, and went about other 
chores, as was her usual practice. She did not realize how much hotter the 
Viking range was than her old one - until she saw the baskets hanging from 
the kitchen ceiling were on fire. The fire was too hot for her to get to 
the fire extinguisher.</p>

<p>The fire quickly spread to the dining room. The whole patio side of the 
room was glass, which quickly burst. Just outside that glass was Stews new 
giant gas grill, with a huge tank of propane. A plug facing the dining 
room melted loose, allowing the tank to discharge it's contents into the 
house like a giant flame thrower.</p>

<p>This burned through the wood floor, so flames dropped into the narrow 
basement where Connie's craft supplies were stored. There were big cans of 
solvents and oil base paints, which all enthusiastically joined the party.
</p>

<p>The fire progressed to Ben's bedroom, faced with sliding glass doors 
high over the driveway. There was a swarm of plastic model airplanes 
hanging from the ceiling. These could be seen catching fire and raining 
down flaming plastic.</p>

<p>The fire guys arrived and put out the fire. One of them remarked, 
"In home fires most of the damage is usually from water, but here we 
couldn't find anything to damage".</p>

<p>All that remains of this luxury home is the splash of aluminum I picked 
up from the driveway. It had dripped down from the sliding glass door of 
Ben's bedroom.</p>

<p><img src="img/connie10k.jpg" alt="Connie &amp; Stew's new home" class=mrg>
Monday morning Stew called the architect and told him there was a change 
of plan, that the project had become much more extensive.</p>

<p>The new house was much larger - with a huge kitchen. Suspended from the 
high ceiling, over the stove area, was a big square of polished copper pipe, 
with sprinkler heads. I don't know if Connie ever again made Swedish rosette 
cookies.</p>

<p>Eventually Connie insisted they move to a different house, because she 
was tired of having to go up and down stairs all the time - this house was 
built into a steep hillside, so there were stairs to deal with.</p>

<p>Note that in the photo, the visible part of the new house is much the same 
as the old house, as that part was designed to be built on the old 
foundations. It includes the sliding glass doors over the driveway that the 
splash of aluminum came from.</p>
