I was home from this adventure on Valentines Day February 15, 2022. Home, 
yes, but the saga was far from over. This is the story of a Heart Attack, 
type LAD, "The Widow Maker". It came suddenly in the night, with no previous 
hint of its approach. It is also a story about the people and facilities 
responsible for my still being alive to write this.</span>

<p>This page is written mainly for my own review, but you are welcome to 
read it if you wish.

<p>Friday morning (11 Feb 2022, around 6:00 am) I became partially awake, 
and very uncomfortable. I was sucking in air in great breaths, and they were 
very cold, much colder than my bedroom air is. The image before me was of 
a stack of tubes, from which the air came. Then I fully awoke - to intense
pain in my chest, both shoulders, and both sides of my back.  In addition 
I had pain in my bowls of such intensity as I've never experienced before.</p>

<p>I had a good idea what the other pains might be, but not the bowel pain, 
which confused the issue. I waited a little while, but decided I'd better 
take action. As I got out of bed I was struck by an extreme case of diarrhea. 
I had to make three dashes to the toilet for explosive dumps before I could 
take time to dial 911.</p>

<p>I dressed quickly, but The Los Angeles County Fire Department arrived 
so quickly I didn't have time to tie my shoes. The fire guys made a quick 
assessment, asked some questions, and ran an EKG. One of them then gave me 
3 chewable aspirins and told me to chew them. Then he asked me to lift my 
tongue, and gave me three squirts of nitroglycerin. Meanwhile another 
inserted an IV Catheter in my left arm, first of 4.</p>

<p>By this time, the Los Angeles County ambulance had arrived. They had me get 
on a gurney and told me they were taking me to Huntington Hospital, because 
with something this serious I needed a specialist hospital. So, with sirens 
wailing, we got on the road. An IV drip was attached to the catheter for the 
trip.</p>

<p>At Huntington, they wheeled me into a receiving room and took a couple COVID 
swabs. A doctor came in and looked at the Fire Department's EKG. He advised me 
this was very severe, and gave two options, but strongly advised surgery for 
something this serious.</p>

<p>I signed a paper and they wheeled me immediately into the Cardio Lab. 
Fortunately this was a week day, as the Lab is closed on weekends, and it 
would have taken longer to get the crew together. Surgery took 1 hour and 15 
minutes. They found my main artery was blocked from groin to heart. They 
reamed it out and inserted stents for the full length.</p>

<p>I was conscious during this whole operation, but feeling no pain. Though 
fabrics blocked much of my view, I could often see part of one of the screens 
and could watch wires and stuff traveling up my artery. At one point I could 
see my hip and pelvic bones.</p>

<h2><u>First Day</u>:</h2> &nbsp; I was wheeled off to a room for recovery. 
A doctor told me, "Don't even think about checking out".<p></p>

<p>Technicians came by and hooked me up to a monitor checking my heartbeat, 
and blood oxygen continuously, and blood pressure every 5 minutes. Of course 
there were IV drips, probably two by now. In this hospital they aren't 
actually "drips", because the tubes pass through pumps that control the 
rate of flow.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, a Nurse and assistant came and removed the automatic 
monitor machine and wired me to a pocket sized heart monitor that continuously 
sent data to a big screen somewhere. It only lit up the local screen when the 
batteries were changed, or it was nearly out of battery. I didn't learn how to 
turn on the local display until my last day.</p>

<p>Then they sat me up and installed a Hospital Gown with a pocket for the 
heart monitor. They unplugged the drip pumps (they run on batteries for an 
hour or two) and with one guiding the drip stand (it had wheels) and the 
other holding the hospital gown closed in back, they marched me a ways down 
the hall and back. I plopped into the bed.</p>

<h3>Nurses:</h3> &nbsp; Every one of the Nurses and Assistants was a guy. I 
didn't see a single female nurse until the morning of my departure. There 
were various young ladies, and I do mean young, and small, who wheeled around 
testing machines, hooking them up, and recording blood pressure, heartbeat, 
and blood oxygen, about every 4 hours, day and night. They were tightly 
wrapped in the same dark blue scrubs as the guys.<p></p>

<p>During my stay I was visited by five Vampires, each of whom drew blood. 
The first two who visited me were of the young ladies described in the 
paragraph above. The later three were black ladies of larger stature.</p>

<h3>COVID:</h3> &nbsp; Patients did not wear masks, but all had been tested 
for COVID 19 when entered into the hospital. All staff wore N95 or KN95 masks. 
some of the nurses wore an N95 with a KN95 over it, and eye shields. The N95 
is official with elastic straps over the head and back of the neck. A KN95 has 
ear straps and is considered a little less secure.<p></p>

<h3>The Room:</h3> &nbsp; Once wheeled from the Cardio Lab, I was in the 
same room until discharged. The room was quite nice, spacious, and with 
windows. It had it's own bathroom. Oddly, my perception of this room in 
memory is very limited from time to time depending on what was going on 
and who and what equipment was there. This changing perception solidified 
into the single complete room concept by the third day.<p></p>

<h3>Hospital Gown:</h3> &nbsp; This is one of the most useless and 
unmanageable misdesigned things ever made of fabric. People would have more 
dignity going around naked. The heart monitor fell out of the pocket within 
minutes. The gown became completely tangled with the blankets, I couldn't 
tell what was what in the dark. Somehow I got it untangled and tossed it.
<p></p>

<h3>Hospital Bed:</h3> &nbsp; This was a very expensive unit. It could raise 
from flat to sitting or lift the legs under patient control. Aside from that,  
it was entirely weird. The sleeping surface was composed of air bags, which it 
would inflate and deflate to try to maximize comfort. It did this whenever it 
felt like, and often, and with a loud growling sound. If you moved, it would 
wait around 30 seconds, then adjust again. If you changed the pitch of the 
backrest, 30 seconds later it would be inflating and deflating airbags all 
over the place.

<p>This bed had no place to hold heart monitors, phones, it's own nurse call / 
TV remote unit, or anything else. Everything was either falling on the floor 
or getting tangled in the mechanism. The hand holds were poorly placed and 
hard to hold onto. Every time I told a nurse or assistant it had serious 
design flaws, the response was, "No kidding!". One told me patients are often 
asking, "How do I turn this thing off". His response, "This thing is incredibly 
complex and cost more than my car. I don't know if it even can be turned off".
</p>

<p>This first night was awful, I got no sleep - and it wasn't the bed's fault. 
The night staff were running what sounded like a carnival in the next rooms. 
It was very loud and all night long.  In the morning I noticed there was a 
heavy wood door behind the privacy curtain, and asked that it be closed 
every night, and told them why. This was ordered. I had to partially counter 
the order telling staff they could open the door to come through, and that it 
could be left open during the day.</p>

<h2><u>Second Day</u>:</h2> &nbsp; I was encouraged to order something to eat 
from the hospital kitchen. I didn't actually feel like eating, but did 
order 2 multigrain pancakes. They were very bland. I didn't quite finish 
the second one. A chest Xray was taken, and an ultrasound image of the 
heart.<p></p>

<p>There was concern for my breathing being shallow. A new IV drip was set 
up that was supposed to dehydrate me, particularly my lungs. Unfortunately, 
I was constantly falling asleep due to sleep deprivation from the previous 
night. I almost screwed up the test because I'd missed that it was already 
running and discarded the sample before realizing it was live. Fortunately 
I knew the exact volume of the sample, which was sufficient for staff. 
The sample was the amount of urine in a urinal bottle.</p>

<p>Breathing did become easier, and I was given a device that measured my 
ability to inhale. I should have taken that with me at discharge, but I 
didn't. There was, however, some disagreement among the doctors as to 
whether I might have a touch of pneumonia. In any case, they provided a 
heavy dose of antibiotics, by IV drip, of course.</p>

<p>That afternoon one of the IV catheters needed to be replaced. The nurse 
tried three times, then called in a young woman he said was the best at it. 
She tried four times and failed. One problem was probably dehydration from 
the morning event. They called in a guy who had an ultrasound probe, and 
he set the catheter into a deeper vein in two minutes.</p>

<p>One thing that bothered me a lot was total lack of the communication and 
writing environment I normally enjoy. I had no computer, editing software, 
or even paper to record things (I did have a pen). I could do no work. I was 
also totally isolated from the outside world. I thought of asking for a 
computer with email, but couldn't remember anyone's email address anyway, I 
type them so seldom.</p>  

<h3>Strangeness:</h3> &nbsp; This night there was no loud noise, and I slept, 
but rather strangely.	Much of this I attribute to my isolation as explained
above. It was divided into two sections by the arrival of one of the young 
ladies with a monitoring machine.<p></p>

<p>In the first segment, in a dream state, I was presented with many pages 
from my Web site, except not from my waking Web site, and not on computer 
screen, but as sets of documents that could be opened up and examined. Each 
document, and its sub-documents had a black circular emblem with a complex 
design in the upper left corner, where my waking documents have colorful 
photos. The emblem were the same for every document. This whole sequence 
somehow had a very definite Japanese feel to it.</p>

<p>I opened documents and examined them. They seemed to be in html format. 
I was finding things that needed to be corrected. I started to realize I 
could not correct them now, because there was no method to do so, and I 
could only go on to the next. I could not save any information, and 
realized I wouldn't be able to remember any of these corrections when I 
left this dream state. I continued on reviewing documents until awakened 
for blood pressure testing.</p>

<p>The second section was also in a dream state with an overall Japanese 
feel to it. Here I was presented, similarly to the documents in the first 
set, bright red lozenges, about 2 inches long. At this time I was quite 
aware I could do nothing, so I just watched them pass.</p>

<p>These episodes made me very aware of what it was like for primitive 
humans, who had no way to preserve information except through story and 
song. Fortunately, they worked in a waking state and could preserve 
information in their minds until they could compose stories and songs. 
I didn't even have that, because in the dream state, each thought erased 
the previous one.</p> 

<h2><u>Third Day</u>:</h2> &nbsp; Some time during the early hours of the 
morning, the diarrhea returned. Since I was tethered with tubes to an 
IV rack, to get to the bathroom I had to unplug the pumps from the wall 
and tow the rack along with me to the bathroom. This was not totally 
successful, and there was some mess that I cleaned up.  This was repeated 
later in the morning, again with some mess to clean up.

<p>Of course there were more IV drips, but for one the tube was too short, 
so they moved the rack around to the other side of the bed, where it was 
very crowded. This resulted in disaster. The diarrhea struck again, hard, 
and I just couldn't get at the plugs to pull them. I ran out of time and 
could not stop the outpour. This time I called for clean-up. What a mess.<p>

<p>Since the short tube drip was done, I had the rack moved back to the 
other side. there were a couple more diarrhea events, but they were minor 
with plenty of time to get into the bathroom.</p>

<p>I was again urged to order food from the kitchen. This time I did order 
the oven baked fish with some potatoes. It was, again, pretty bland.</p>

<h3>Hospital Food:</h3> &nbsp; The problem with hospital food is not the 
skills of the kitchen staff. The food they prepare must be acceptable to 
<u>everyone</u>, which means bland. Further, dishes must meet requirements 
of the various diets. In my case I was assigned to the "Heart Healthy" diet, 
For this the kitchen adhered to the AHA salt recommendation, which salt 
metabolism experts consider dangerously low. The experts don't worry about 
it, figuring that only a few nut cases would ever be able to get their salt 
intake that low, but the hospital is trying, so super bland.<p></p>

<p>The doctors were indicating I'd be discharged on Monday, the 4th day, 
but in the evening it was found my heartbeat had become erratic, so this 
needed to be fixed. The preferred method was with an IV (what else), which 
would take 24 hours and might or might not work. A small bag of strong 
medicine was dripped in within 10 minutes. Then a large bag was put up to 
drip a dilute solution to replenish the medicine in the body for 24 hours.
</p> 

<h3>Strangeness:</h3> &nbsp; This night, in dream state, I had a very odd 
concept as to how sleep worked. I conceptualized it as a series of tasks to 
be completed going around a clock face. I had completed maybe half the tasks, 
but further progress was halted by a small pile of pictures blocking the 
clock face. Yes, once again, the strong Japanese overtone - the pictures were 
Japanese. I tried to move them out of the way, but couldn't.<p></p>

<p>I remember only the one picture that was completely visible on the top of 
the pile. In the foreground there was a sand dune with patchy vegetation. 
Playing in the sand were a bunch of rather plump Japanese babies. In their 
diapers they looked like miniature sumo wrestlers. In the midrange, just down 
from the dune, there were trees. In the far distance, visible between clumps 
of trees, there was a mushroom cloud. I was given the title, "Never Again", 
and the name of the woman artist, but I failed to remember her name. This 
was at about 2:00am. I was able to reconceptualize sleep to get past the 
photos, but I did not sleep well the rest of the night.</p>

<h2><u>Fourth Day</u>:</h2> &nbsp; This was not an eventful day, as I had 
nothing to do except lie on my back until about 8:00 in the evening. I did 
order a tuna sandwich, with multigrain bread. The lady told me "No. Multigrain 
has salt, it'll conflict with the rest of the tray". When I finished my order 
the lady asked, "That's it? nothing else?". I said "No", and she responded, 
"Since there's nothing else I can put back the multigrain bread". The sandwich 
was, of course, bland.<p></p>

<p>At 20 hours, heartbeat was still erratic, and doctors were discussing using 
a less desirable electric method to do the job. At 21 hours, my heartbeat 
stabilized.<p></p>

<p>I really wanted to sleep this night, but was prevented from doing so by 
the bed. Every time I felt myself sliding into sleep, the bed would wake up 
with a growl and start pumping air around, "to make me more comfortable". 
It seemed to have the timing down perfectly.</p>

<h2><u>Fifth Day</u>:</h2> &nbsp; In the morning, a cardiologist came in and 
said, "Well, look at you. You came over all by yourself, so we don't have to 
zap you". I was now to be discharged that day, after a visit from the hospital 
cardiologist. He didn't show up until the nurse made a phone call around 
noon.<p></p>

<p>This morning was the first time I had seen a woman nurse here. Her name was 
Taylor (but not Swift). She did the usual quick checks, a bit more thoroughly 
than any of the guys had, and then pretty much ignored me, as I was now a 
done deal.</p>

<p>Also, Vampire #5 came by to take a sample. She looked at my badly bruised 
and battered left arm and said "Oh my, lets see the other one. I don't want 
to take any bad news to the head vampire downstairs, they get a little crazy". 
The right arm was not as badly bruised and battered so she drew blood from 
there.</p>

<p>After the hospital cardiologist came by, the nurse came by to to finish 
things up. I had removed the portable heart monitor because one wire had 
come disconnected and it wasn't working, so I gave that to her. She checked 
a couple other things, and then as the last task removed the two IV 
catheters.</p>

<h3>The Volvo Key:</h3> &nbsp; On day two, an assistant named Orlando came 
into the room, and said he'd forgotten to inventory my posessions. They were 
in patient property bags on a chair. He tallied them, then showed me the list 
he'd made and asked if that was all. I told him there was also a Volvo key and 
described it. He searched the property bags, pants pockets, and inside my 
shoes. No Volvo key.

<p>He tried for days to locate that key. The last place I'd seen it was on 
the floor of the Cardio Lab, being picked up by a woman. He couldn't check 
the Lab, as it was closed during the weekend, but he did ask there Monday 
morning. No key was found.</p>

<p>I got dressed to get ready to go. Finally, I picked up the two property 
bags, and there, on the chair cushion, was the Volvo key. </p>

<p>I was asked by the nurse if I had my car here at the hospital. I replied, 
"No", so she asked me if I had a car at home so I could go out and get my 
prescription meds. I replied, "Yes". The staff there said they'd fetch an 
Uber. A nurse assistant accompanied me down to the main lobby, and we waited. 
The Uber never showed up. We went back up, and the staff there called a Lyft, 
which did show up.</p>

<p>I was concerned about the house, because I knew the fire guys wouldn't 
be able to lock it, and there would be newspapers in the driveway letting 
people know I wasn't home. I found that someone had tossed the newspapers 
up onto the porch, perhaps someone who had seen me being taken away. The 
house was all OK.</p>

<p>First Task was to make the bed, as the sheets had been somewhat soiled 
by the initial diarrhea attack. After getting to sleep, I was delighted 
to have a short but normal dream time sequence with no Japanese overtones 
at all.</p>

<p>And, after all this, they tell me February is "Heart Health Month".</p>
