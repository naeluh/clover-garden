<p><span class=bg>
Denise was born Denise Gail Durham on August 20, 1949, I believe in 
Southern California, and died on November 22 2019 in Glendale, 
California. The photo to the left was taken at my dining room table 
in May 2012. For more photos, see the gallery at the bottom of this 
page.</span></p>

<p><span class=bg>Denise was very intelligent, curious by nature, and 
had a Bachelor's degree. Unfortunately, by her own admission, she lived 
a life of making bad decisions. A good part of that life she was 
homeless and living in her car.

<p>This is the story of Denise, as well as I know it, and it is 
a rather strange story. Denise was born into a once prosperous but 
declining black family. Despite reportedly having only one white 
ancestor, in her young adulthood, she was light complexioned and 
blond, with greenish eyes, and definitely attractive. She said only 
anthropologists recognized her as being black, due to the length of 
her arms compared to her body.</p>

<p>Denise had a background with Christian Science and often quoted Mary 
Baker Eddy, but also had involvement with Buddhism and Hinduism, 
particularly Buddhism. Due to her sophisticated family background, 
she exhibited no trace of "black culture" and loved classical 
music of all periods.</p>

<p>During the Vietnam war, Denise was in her mid 20s and in Southeast 
Asia, where she married the guy who gave her the name Vilay. He was 
Cambodian, and it had something to do with the CIA, but I never got 
the full story. I seem to recall she had a miscarriage on the plane 
coming back to the US.</p>

<p>She went to a technical school and graduated in Program Analysis. 
As so often happens to people attending technical schools, what she 
had learned was obsolete by time she graduated, and she never had a 
job in that field. She didn't complete paying off her student loans 
until about 2010.</p>

<p>I met Denise at Liz Hargrove's Seminars for Singles in Pasadena, 
some time in the mid 1980s. At this time she drove a Fiat sports car 
and worked at the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. She was 
cheerful and active. She soon became my live-in girlfriend. People 
thought we were a lovely couple, but problems soon began to appear.
</p>

<p>In those days, by her own admission, she considered men to be 
entirely disposable, and her tolerance was low. At one point I declined  
to have sex with her outdoors where we could have been observed by 
neighbors. She was angered, and told me my attitude toward sex did not 
match hers. Later, I didn't do the right thing for some Hallmark event. 
It wasn't Valentines day, but might have been her birthday. Anyway, 
she said I wasn't romantic enough and moved out.</p>

<p>Her next relationship was a total disaster from which she never 
recovered. She suckered for the kind of guy women are most vulnerable 
to, a guy with a phony British accent, claiming to be related to 
nobility, and spouting a strongly romantic line. He told her they were 
going to do wonderful romantic things and to quit her job at the DMV 
without notice. She did, and that crippled her for future employment. 
He pretty soon found he couldn't get anything more out of her, and 
dumped her on the street - off to find another woman anxious for 
romance.</p>

<p>I know nothing of what she did right after that, but when her mother 
died, in 1991, she got enough money to buy a new car, a Honda Civic, 
which ended up being her home off and on over the years.</p>

<p>Much of her life is lost to me, but every once in a while she would 
show up, live with me very briefly, and work for me part time for a year 
or so.</p>

<p>In 1995 Denise was working for me, but her mind was apparently 
crumbling a bit. She accused myself and Trudy Holt, who was also working 
for me, of smoking crack, and that we should do so outside, as she had 
to smoke her cigarettes outside. Neither of us had ever used crack, and 
I never used any recreational drugs of any kind, except beer and wine. 
She was extremely insistent on this matter, claiming she could smell the 
stuff all day. She said we were denying it because we were afraid she 
might ask for some. She had also made inappropriate comments to clients. 
Trudy and I consulted with a Human Resources expert, who advised we had 
no choice but to discharge her immediately.</p>

<p>Denise went back on the road. I know that in 1996 she had an address 
in Flagstaff, Arizona, then in San Jos&eacute;, California, then in 1997 
she was in Seattle, Washington.</p>

<p>In 2002 she was living in Pasadena, and had a job with a normal 
company. Unfortunately, it was in decline during hard economic times 
and she was eventually laid off, and was back on the road.</p>

<p>Somewhere along the line she was living on the Navaho reservation, 
but she had always had a talent for outstaying her welcome, and was 
asked to leave.</p>

<p>Somewhere along the line she married an Arab or Iranian, probably 
for an immigration thing (on his part, at least). That didn't work 
out, but around 2010 she was still dealing with him on the phone. 
I think she got a legal divorce.</p>

<p>Some night around 2007 I heard a knock on my bedroom door. It was 
Denise. She told me later she had been sleeping on my porch for a 
few nights. So, she lived with me again, very briefly, but it just 
wouldn't work out, so she got a room up the street with Beverly.</p>

<p>Trudy was long gone, and so was Julie, with whom she had a fist 
fight back in the '90s, so I was able to keep her on as a part time 
employee. We occasionally played at sex, but only play, as her lady 
parts had already become unusable, painful if touched. She was, by now, 
under the care of the State, and being maintained on medication. 
She seemed happy and was talking about taking classes for a teaching 
job.</p>

<p>Then in 2008, disaster struck again. Denise decided the meds were 
making her fat and asked they be changed. In actuality, she was not 
fat, still quite away from even "pleasingly plump". Whatever she was 
prescribed, the person who prescribed it should be in prison. It 
totally destroyed her.</p>

<p>I kept her on part time for about 1-1/2 years, but all she did was 
stand at the kitchen window counting the cars entering and coming 
out of the Vons parking lot. When she had to go to the bathroom she 
would write down her counts so she could take them up when she got 
back. I would not touch her for fear of being accused of molesting 
an incompetent person.</p>

<p>Finally, that prescriber was transferred and she got a new 
prescription. She started to recover, and occasional sex play returned. 
Now, though, she was holding conversations with Jesus and the Dalai 
Lama, often and out loud. She had long had an image of the Dalai Lama 
in the wall of her workstation, and some other Buddhist and Hindu things.
</p>

<p>Then she fell under the spell of a TV Evangelist. Down came the 
Dalai Lama and all the other stuff. She installed a Baby Jesus gazebo 
at her workstation, purchased from the preachers organization. She 
declared there would be no sex play at all, and asked me to get her a 
Bible.</p>

<p>I ordered a nice study Bible and gave it to her.  I know she read 
it intensively between then and the next time she came to work - 
because her next work day the gazebo was gone and the Dalai Lama was 
back on the wall. She later told me she left the gazebo on Beverly's 
coffee table, but nobody remembers what happened to it.</p>

<p>Then, in December 2010, her car failed beyond her ability to have 
it fixed. Now she really went off the deep end, and was soon towed 
away by a representative from the State. Her last act before being 
taken away was to donate $500, about all she had, to the Heifer 
Foundation, to buy someone a cow in a 3rd world country. She told me 
later it really made her feel good.</p>

<p>Her cousin, Tracy, got her set up in a room at Garfield Care Center 
in Pasadena, paid for by Medicare, Medical, etc. I visited her there, 
and we eventually established a routine where I'd pick her up once a 
week and bring her to my place for dinner. She'd sleep here overnight, 
and I'd get her back to Garfield in the morning.</p>

<p>During this time her mind was still fairly sharp, thought her short 
term memory was a bit shaky. She enjoyed reading books on astrophysics, 
and other complex things. This situation continued from mid 2011 until 
August 2019, but in August she was clearly in declining health and 
eating very little at supper. Then she stopped eating even her beloved 
steel cut oats at breakfast.</p>

<p>In late August she was sent to the hospital, then transferred to 
Glenoaks Convalescent Care. It took me a while to find out where she 
was because of medical security. Having located her, I got the news 
she was dying of lung cancer. The social worker registered me as next 
of kin, along with her cousin Tracy, but Tracy was much involved with 
matters of a recently deceased husband and told them I could make any 
decisions regarding Denise.</p>

<p>I made an arrangement with the Hospice that had assigned her to 
Glenoaks to continue bringing her here overnight once a week, but she 
soon became too weak, especially since she had stopped eating entirely. 
I continued to visit her every week. I visited on November 22, 2019, 
and she did not respond to her name. She died within minutes of my 
visit, age 70. As arranged by a social worker, her lungs were removed 
for study. She was cremated, and her ashes were scattered at sea.</p>

<p>I was not informed of her death, and learned of it a week later 
when I visited. I was too late to recover her three favorite stuffed 
animals, so they died with her. She called them "her babies". There was 
a sheep, an elephant and an orange critter she thought was a bear. She 
had a bunch of smaller critters which I have here, and I have her 
violin from her school days, which she abandoned here in the 1980s.
</p>

<p>Rest peacefully, Denise, wherever you might be now.</p>
