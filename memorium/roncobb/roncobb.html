<h1>Ron Cobb</h1>
<hr class=hr2>

<p><span class=bg>Ron Cobb was born Ronald Ray Cobb on September 21, 
1937, in or around Burbank California. He died on his 83rd birthday, 
September 21, 2020 of Lewy body dementia, in Sydney, Australia. He 
had lived mostly in Australia since 1972 and was married to Australian 
writer Robin Love.</span></p>

<p>Ron was drafted into the Army in 1960 and was sent to Vietnam as 
a Signal Corps draftsman in 1963. He had a Vietnamese girlfriend 
while he was there, and had me produce a few color portrait prints of 
her. For reasons unknown to me, she was never brought to the United 
States.</p>

<p>Ron became a very well known film designer. Early in his career, he 
worked on <i>ET</i>, which he disliked, and reportedly never saw. He left 
the project but did receive royalties. He also worked on <i>Dark Star</i> 
(1974), <i>Star Wars</i> (1977), <i>Alien</i> (1979), <i>Raiders of the 
Lost Ark</i> (1981), <i>Conan the Barbarian</i> (1982), <i>Back to the 
Future</i> (1985), <i>The Abyss</i> (1989), <i>Total Recall</i> (1990) 
and many lesser known films and games in the U.S. and Australia. He 
continued to work on films and games until at least 2006</p>

<p>The announcement of Ron's death to Musica Donavania members is

<h3>Testimony - Andrew Grygus</h3>

<p><img src="img/ajghair05c.jpg" alt="Andrew Grygus 2020" class=mrg>
Ron Cobb was one of two true founders of the Chesley Donavan Foundation - 
from which <a href="../../music/index.html">
<b>Musica Donavania</b></a> evolved. Originally it was named "CD Inc." 
for "Cobb Duke Inc.", but the name was change to "Chesley Donavan 
Foundation" when other people started joining the group. Meetings were 
held in Tad Duke's father's welding shop in Burbank. I became a member 
of CD in 1959 or 1960 while Ron was serving in the Army, but meetings 
had already been moved to Helen Urban's garage in Burbank. Much more 
on the beginnings of the Chesley Donavan Foundation can be found on 
the page <a href="../../music/ancient/index.html">
<b>History of Musica Donavania</b></a>.</p>

<p>Ron never returned to CD meetings, and I met him through friends.
Now and then, for some years in the mid and late 1960s, I would hang 
out with various counter-culture personalities in Ron's digs in Hollywood 
and West Los Angeles. He was becoming notable as a political cartoonist, 
starting with the Los Angeles Free Press. He also did other freelance 
design work, but his spectacular film career was still well in the 
future. I pretty much lost track of Ron when he moved to Australia.</p>

<p>Ron did live in the U.S. temporarily during some film projects, 
particularly in Topanga Canyon, but I did not see him during this 
period. All my contacts associated with Ron were gone, especially due 
to my 30 year exile from CD and the "Music Group" that was forming 
from it.</p>

<p>Ron was inadvertently responsible for my exile from CD and the 
Music Group, due to his encouraging me to take up doing art work. 
This absurd story is detailed on the <a href="../ajg/banished.html">
<b>Banished from CD</b></a> page. I was still in exile during his 
trip to the U.S. in 2000 (see photos below)</p>

<b>Some Reminiscences Of My Friendship With Ron Cobb</b></p>

<p>Through mutual friends in the Chesley Donavan Foundation, I met Ron Cobb 
in the early 1960s when he had finished his service in the Army.  He was 
living in a small apartment on Whitley Terrace in Hollywood, just off 
Cahuenga Blvd. near the Hollywood Bowl.  Some of his neighbors there 
were also artists although it wasn't a commune; each lived alone.</p>

<p>He had already become well known as an editorial/political cartoonist for 
the Los Angeles Freepress, and keeping with its name, Ron worked at the 
"Freep" unpaid, so money was tight for him.  By invitation I became a 
regular at frequent informal gatherings at his place.  It was then that 
Ron received an invitation to exhibit his political cartoons at a movie 
house that showed imported films on Wednesday evenings.</p>

<p>This "Art House" was located on Melrose Ave. and as Ron had no car, 
it was a bit far for him to walk.  So I became his transport so that he 
could be on hand to talk with movie goers who might be interested in 
purchasing his art, thus providing some needed income and wider artistic 
exposure.</p>

<p>Ron moved to a larger house on Cahuenga near Franklin Ave. and later 
to an apartment on Orange Grove in West Hollywood.  Ron was a great 
conversationalist and raconteur.  There were many evenings when we all 
gathered at his place for hours of intellectual and political discussions 
with cups of tea and a very occasional glass of beer or wine.  When I 
knew him, he was never much of a drinker and I don't remember him ever 
using drugs.</p>

<p>Our association ended just before he found fame in the film industry, 
as our lives naturally began to move in different circles and directions.
</p>

<p>I saw Ron again years later for one evening at a Musica Donavania 
meeting at Bon & Tim Callahan's home in Altadena.  Then it was back to 
Oz for him.</p>

<p>I emailed him one last time in 2018 with some reminiscences of our 
early associations but received a reply from his wife Robin saying that 
he remembered those times well but was, sadly, too ill to respond.</p>  

<p>Ron and Tad Duke were the beginning of the Chesley Donavan Foundation, 
which was the wellspring of the Musica Donavania music group, which has 
been continuously active in Los Angeles for over six decades.  Well done 
Ron Cobb.</p>
