<h1>Alex Bratmon</h1>
<hr class=hr2>

<p><span class=bg>Alex had a long career as an engineer in the 
aerospace industry. He was also a long time participant in Musica 
Donavania. During his marriage, he and his wife, Candy, hosted a 
number of Musica Donavania events. Alex was also an avod Science 
Fiction fan.</span></p>

<p>Alex was not able to attended Musica Donavania events for several 
years, as declining health caused him to be confined to care facilities, 
and it was in one of these facilities that he passed away at around 
2:00pm on 14 May 2020. It was the year of COVID-19, but his death did 
not involve COVID pandemic. It was related to multiple heart attacks 
and strokes over the previous few years - and was very sudden.</p>

<p>This page is currently under construction, and hopefully a lot more 
material will soon appear here.  I myself cannot contribute very much, 
as most of his active time in Musica Donavania was during the 30 years 
I was exiled from the group by Jon Lackey.</p>

<h2>Alex &amp; Edie</h2>
<p>
We met thanks to some matchmaking by Bonnie Callahan. Thank you Bonnie!  
I am so glad he remained friends with old girlfriends. He would call and 
we would have long 2-hour conversations that were wide ranging on many 
topics.  I soon realized that he was checking me out to see if I was on 
his level.</p>
<p>The day came when he let me into his apartment.  Before he opened the 
door, he said, "Try not to say 'Oh My God!' too many times". Big clue. 
Being the compulsive cleaner that I am, I soon began to make progress, 
filling up the dumpsters as I worked. We both had trust issues 
but decided to give it another chance and we were glad we did.</p>
<p>We had fun going to the L.A. County Fair. Having a flat tire and 
getting lost in the dark on the way home was not fun!  "Which way is 
the freeway?" became a running joke between us.</p>
<p> He was generous and was always ready to help others. When he put 
the details of our first date into his smart phone, I knew it was 
official.Try as I might, I could not get into science fiction, which 
was a disappointment for him.  I'm grateful for the time we had 
together, and he will always be in my heart.</p>

I cannot contribute any additional ingredients to the cake. I can only say 
how much I enjoyed my friendship with Alex, which for the most part was only 
experienced at the gatherings of the Donovanians: Science-Fiction & Fantasy 
& Classical-Music Lovers. I did visit him twice at the care home in Azusa, 
but that's it.</p>

<p>I will miss Alex for the rest of my journey here, and will rejoice in the 
friendship we had.</p>
