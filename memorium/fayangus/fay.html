<h1>Fay Daphne Angus</h1>
<hr class=hr2>

<p><span class=bg>Fay Angus was born into a missionary family on May 25th 1929 
in Brisbane, Australia. When she was age two, her family moved to 
China, where Fay attended a Christioan girls school. When she was 10 
years old, the Japanese invaded China, and Fay was sent to an internment 
camp, where she remained until the conquest of the Japanese Empire. This 
was a very difficult time, and she almost lost faith, but pulled 
through by strength of character.</span></p>

<p><span class=bg>During her adult life, Fay married John S. Angus. They 
moved to Southern California, where John worked as an engineer for the 
City of Los Angeles. They lived in a lovely home in the hills of Sierra 
Madre, bringing up one son and one daughter.</span></p>

<p><span class=bg>During this time, Fay wrote a number of books on Christian 
living, and one, <i>White Pagoda</i>, describing the experiences of 
children in the Japanese internment camps. She also worked with estate 
sales and antiques.</span></p>

<p><span class=bg>Fay was very active in the Sierra Madre community, 
particularly working to preserve the character of the town in opposition 
to exploitation by developers. For this she had many friends, and a few 
who were not quite so friendly.</span></p>

<p><span class=bg>Fay was greatly valued for her perpetually cheerful 
politeness and generosity, as well as for her endearing British accent. 
She died very suddenly on February 17th 2016, of a massive stroke, and 
is very much missed by those who knew her well. The photo is of Fay at 
the 2008 Christmas party at Mary's Store in Sierra Madre.</span></p>

<p>Any additional material on Fay Angus would be welcome.
