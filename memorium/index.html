<h1>in Memoriam</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p><span class=bg>
This Site looks to the future - but also celebrates the slow passing of 
an era, and the people who have been important to our community. These 
are people who reached adulthood without computers, hand held calculators 
or cell phones (not even flip phones). This was long before Arpanet 
became the Internet. It is, however, the era that saw rise of Science 
as a respectable career, the rebirth of pre-Christian spirituality in 
the West, the rise of the Internet and the "information Society". It 
was an era where fast transportation encouraged migrations and the 
introduction of many far-flung cultures to each other - but also 
fragmented families and communities.</span>

<a href="fayangus/fay.html"><h3>Fay Daphne Angus</h3></a>
<p>
Fay was a writer, community activist, mother of two, and all around 
sweet and likable person. She was born May 25th 1929 in Brisbane, 
Australia, spent some time in a Japanese internment camp in China 
during World War II, and lived a long and productive life in Sierra 
Madre, California. She died very suddenly on February 17th 2016.

<p>
Jon Stinger had a particular interest in music, and was an avid collector 
of recordings, particularly of early music (Medieval into Classical). 
He organized music programs for the Music Group form many years. He was 
also very interested in film noir, narrow gage steam railroads, and the 
old Los Angeles Red Cars.

<p>
OK, I confess, I'm not actually dead (2020), and don't expect to be dead 
for some time (even though the paranoids are all plotting against me). 
I'm starting my own memorial page now because I'm very confident nobody 
else would ever get around to it. I can't get them to write up pages for 
people who were actually important in their lives.

<a href="denise/denise.html"><h3>Denise Gail Vilay</h3></a>
<p>
Denise, by her own admission, lived a life of making bad decisions. 
She spent much of her life homeless and living in her car, and at 
her death, she was already pretty much forgotten, except by myself. 
Here I have described her story, as well as I know it.

Donavania, and in past times hosted a number of Musica Donavania events. 
Alex was also an avod Science Fiction fan.

<a href="jonlackey/jonlackey.html"><h3>Jon Lackey</h3></a>
<p>Jon Lackey was a tall, imposing man. He was an artist of considerable 
talent and ability, and very wide interests. He had a certain charisma 
which attracted people to him. His ambitions were great, but often 
thwarted by aspects of his own personality.
