<h1>Table Service</h1>
<hr class=hr2>
<p>Table Service can be divided neatly between Asia and the West. Western 
service evolved significantly over the centuries, while Asian service has 
been relatively stable - until now. Adoption of Western forms of industry,  
and commerce are forcing changes in dining habits and household makeup to 
meet demands of the new economy.</p>
<p>One important principle held equally for both East and West - until 
recently. Those few who could afford real food could also afford plenty 
of servants and/or slaves to prepare and serve it. This has been broken 
in the West, in India and Southeast Asia by social change and economic 
reality. Even the well-to-do have a big problem employing reliable 
servants, and slaves are out of the question in most regions. And now 
every Tom, Dick and Rajif seems to think real food should be some sort 
of birthright.</p>
<p>In China this old order was destroyed by the Communist Revolution, 
and in Japan by losing a war and (however reluctantly) getting 
Americanized. Older Japanese complain bitterly that the young don't even 
know how to use chopsticks. South and Central America are pretty much 
Western now, leaving only Africa in a state of primitivism (with an 
overlay of Western style luxury for the very wealthy few).  &nbsp;

Long ago in prehistoric times our hunter-gatherer ancestors lived a 
much more leisurely life than we do today. Populations were small and 
scattered, and the Earth provided amply, most of the time.</p>
<p>Table manners and table settings were not yet invented, because tables 
hadn't yet been invented, and Emily Post was an annoyance yet far in the 
misty future.</p>

<p>Food was eaten raw until the taming of fire, which allowed meat to 
be (a little) more tender and many formerly inedible or toxic vegetables 
to be made safe and nutritious. This is now known to have occurred in a 
pre-human population, and the improvement in nutrition is considered 
to have been critical to development of more powerful brains of humans.
</p>

<p>Eating was done at the fire, where food was cooked in the embers or 
on hot rocks - there were no cooking vessels and plates were either a 
large leaf or a shard of bark, depending on climate. If you had in hand 
a large tough piece of meat, you could just bite down on it and cut it 
off with a flint knife (flint knives are extremely sharp).</p>

<p>Boiling also became common. How do you boil stuff when you have no 
pots? You dig out a log like a canoe. You pour in your water and 
ingredients (often roots). Then you drop in red hot rocks from the 
fire. Examples of these logs have been found in Ireland.
&nbsp; <small>Modern replication of paleolithic art from Altamira Cave 
considered to be in the Public Domain</small>.</p>

<p>In this environment, life was pretty leisurely with plenty of time for 
social interaction and music making. Today, even the last remaining 
hunter-gatherer societies, though forced into some of the least productive 
regions of the Earth, have a lot more free time than we do - so what 
went wrong?</p>

<p>Permanent agricultural settlements were established. An increasing 
number of archaeologists, basing their opinion on recent finds and 
chemical analysis, believe the major reason for establishing these 
settlements was for reliable production of beer and wine. Over-ripe 
berries and week-old gruel were simply no longer sufficient to meet 
the social and religious needs of an increasingly jaded populace. 
Breweries, wineries, nightclubs and oracular cult centers were 
established all over the world.</p> 

<p>With these settlements came division of labor, and with division of 
labor came division of wealth and social station. Tables were invented, 
and with them often absurdly elaborate orders of service and table 
manners - to make it impossible for those not born into wealth and 
station to pass as if they had been. If you weren't born and raised in 
the structure you'd make sufficient blunders to be found out and cast 
back out into the slave pool.</p>

<h2 id=west>The West</h2>
<p></p>

<h3>Greco - Roman Times:</h3>

<p><p><p><img src="img/triclini02e.jpg" alt="Triclinium" class=mrg>
Little is recorded about food and/or dining in ancient Greece, except 
for Sparta, where the main (only) course was usually "black broth". The 
only seasoning applied was hunger. We know from visitor's complaints about 
the food of Sparta that things were much better elsewhere. Unfortunately 
the Greeks preferred to write about philosophy, war and classical drama 
rather than dining.</p>
 
<p>The Romans wrote quite a bit about food and dining, In most things they 
closely followed Greek practice, considered the height of civilization, so 
we can do some extrapolation backwards.</p>

<p>One thing is certain, the Romans learned of their most important sauce 
and condiment, <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_pdfishsauce.html">Fish Sauce</a>, 
from the Greeks. Whether this was carried to Greece from Thailand or to 
Thailand from Greece is irrelevant. It is such a natural result of 
salting fish that independent invention is just as probable. Fish sauce 
remains as important in Thailand and Vietnam today as it was during the 
Roman Empire.</p>

<p>Roman cooking more resembled Chinese than it did the European cooking 
of later times. In wealthy houses, meals were taken in a dining room 
called a <i>triclinium</i>, reclining diagonally on three wide couches of 
sufficient size to accommodate three diners per couch. The couches 
partially surrounded small low tables which were continuously 
replenished by slaves. The Romans picked up this style from the 
Etruscans, who had picked it up from the Greek colonies in Italy. 
&nbsp; <small> Photo from Museo de historia de Valencia, contributed to 
the Public Domain</small>.</p>

<p>Roman dining differed radically from the Greek in that women dined with 
the men rather than being exiled to a rude family room somewhere else. The 
Romans adopted all aspects of Greek culture except "Greek culture". Rude 
joke: "Sex was discovered by the Ancient Greeks. It was the Romans who 
introduced it to women". Common people and pub patrons ate sitting on 
benches at low tables.</p>

<p>Utensils used were spoons, forks, fingers and bread. Forks were mainly 
two pronged with some three prong examples and were straighter than modern 
forks. The extent to which they were used is currently a matter of debate. 
At the fall of the Empire the fork disappeared from Western Europe, but 
remained in use in Byzantium and as far east as Persia. From Byzantium 
it found it's way back to Italy around the year 1000 and finally worked 
its way back to England in the 1700s.</p>



<h3>The "Dark Ages"</h3>

<p><img src="img/CenturyIV.jpg" alt="4the Century mineature" class=mrg>
Not a lot is known about daily life and dining during this turbulent 
time (4th to 10th centuries). The early Christian Church strongly promoted 
the concept that Christians were ignorant, illiterate and unwashed to 
prove they were "not worldly", an attitude that hung around even into the 
15th century. Libraries of the ancient world were burned (any that 
survived the Christians were burned by the Muslims) and education was 
not encouraged. &nbsp; <small>Illustration copyright expired.</small></p>

<p>While there were a few pockets of literacy, mostly local and short 
lived, they were confined to the clergy. Not much was written about daily 
life to inform future generations, of which there weren't supposed to be 
many. The Rapture was expected "any day now", though a few monks in France 
placed it at the year 1000.</p>
  
<p>Roman sewer systems (at least one of which has been cleaned out and 
restored to service in recent times) and the Roman baths were filled in 
with rubble and trash to enforce the concept of unworldly filth.</p>

<p>You can be pretty sure table service and manners fell into similar 
disrepair, but changes were afoot. With the rise of powerful kings and 
nobilities, and embrace of luxurious living by the Church hierarchy, 
worldliness began to rise from the rubble.</p>
 
<h3>Medieval Times:</h3>

<p><img src="img/mediev01h.jpg" alt="Banquet" class=mrg>
Following the year 1000, Europe, still un-Raptured, began to enjoy greater 
stability and sophistication. In the noble households of Europe, meals 
were served in a communal "great hall" where all persons of significant 
rank were required to eat their meals. If you had no significant social 
rank you were outside hoping for leftovers.  &nbsp; <small>Illustration 
copyright expired.</small></p>
<p>Usually there was a long trestle where people were seated strictly 
according to their social rank. There would be a higher table at the head 
end, "crossing the T", for the host, some family members and important 
guests. A salt cellar (a bowl of salt) was placed at an appropriate point 
along the long trestle. The lower social ranks were seated "below the 
salt" and the higher ranks closer to the "high table".</p>

<p>No food was passed. You could eat only that which was within your 
reach, which would be whatever was thought suitable to your social status. 
There was, of course, a very strict protocol for what dishes were served 
when and which were taken away when and where on the table they were 
placed and taken from.</p>

<p>There would be continuous music and skits for entertainment of the 
diners, and copious singing in which the diners were expected not only 
to participate, but to know all the songs and the words for them.</p>

<p>This was a time of extreme regulation - so many rules and so much 
regulation even the most ardent Washington regulator would be stunned 
into worshipful silence. Every aspect of life and commerce was laid down 
by decree, including who could do what, where they could do it (within 
a few yards at most) and exactly how they had to do it.<p>

<p>Rules of table service were laid out in incredible detail with special 
names for every move you could make with every type of dish. Nobility was 
served not by servants but by lesser nobles, educated from birth in all 
the rules, regulations and special lingo. There was simply no way to break 
into this society except to be born into it - that's the whole point.</p>

<p>Almost every book and article that touches on the Medieval period 
assures us of two things. (1) Spices were applied with a heavy hand 
to cover the taste and smell of spoiled meat. (2) A huge number of 
dishes were served at table and gluttony was the order of the day. 
Both of these scenarios are highly unlikely.</p>

<p>Spices were delivered to Europe from what is now India and Indonesia, 
by very wealthy monopolies. They were <u>incredibly</u> expensive.</p>

<p>We have plenty of surviving instructions to servants for the daily 
purchase of foods, and the extremely tight commerce regulations and 
severe punishments for any vendor violating those regulations. It is 
highly unlikely those who could actually afford spices at all were 
eating spoiled meat. That just doesn't jive with economic and 
regulatory realities.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, recipes from the time list a lot of spices but give no 
quantities. Some argue that spices were applied in interesting blends but 
in modest amounts by "trained from birth" professional cooks, preparing 
meals for sophisticated nobles. Records of commerce do not support this 
view. Dividing the volume of spices imported by the number of those who 
could actually afford them indicates a rather heavy hand. Recipes didn't 
give quantities, because those were governed by the wealth of the host.
Spices were a display of wealth - the more the better to impress.</p>

<p>As for gluttony, there would be many elaborate dishes on the tables, 
but diners could only eat from those within reach, which would be the 
dishes seen fitting to their social standing. They were probably taken 
in moderation - again, rules of etiquette.</p>

<p>There would be a great deal left over. This would first be enjoyed by 
the staff and servants, and that remaining would either become basic 
ingredients for the next meal, or be sent out to feed the poor. Food was 
eaten not from plates but from large slices of bread called "trenchers". 
These would sop up a lot of the elaborate sauces, and these too were sent 
out to the poor - nothing went to waste. This system is still used in many 
wealthy households in North Africa.</p>

<p>Table utensils were brought by the diner and consisted of a spoon and 
one or two knives, forks being unknown in most of Europe. Among the upper 
crust, one knife was used to cut food and another to bring it to the 
mouth. Most food was eaten with the fingers, and, of course, there were 
very strict rules of etiquette for exactly how this was done.</p>

<p>But despite all the rules and regulations, things began to change. 
To the horror of conservatives, by the 1300s couples had started taking 
their meals privately in their own quarters, rather than communally in 
the great hall. Many treatises were written in outrage at this practice 
- but it spread, and greater outrage was to come.</p>

<p>Between the 11th and 14th centuries the fork appeared, first in Italy, 
then France and beyond. It spread slowly, the Church denouncing it 
wherever it appeared as an "affront to God". God had, after all, provided 
fingers for the purpose. The Devil began to be pictured holding a fork, 
as he is to this day. The fork was not common in England until the 18th 
century.</p>

<p>The Medieval tradition of lavish banquets and entertainment eventually 
proved the downfall of the nobility during the Renaissance. Monarchs, 
intent on consolidating power, wanted to prevent armies being raised 
against them. They went on tours of their domain, with a large entourage, 
visiting any noble house thought troublesome. They overstayed their visit 
until the head of household was nearly bankrupt from providing the 
expected food and entertainment. When there was nothing left for raising 
armies or other trouble making, the monarch moved on to the next estate. 
This was particularly the case in England and France. Unfortunately, it 
was not done in Poland, resulting in the fall of the Polish Lithuanian 
Commonwealth.</p>

<h3>The Renaissance</h3>

<p><img src="img/Neptune01h.jpg" alt="Neptune Fountain" class=mrg>
The years between the 14th and 17th century was an era of vast social 
and philosophical evolution. Increasing demand for luxury and ostentation 
by the nobility and church hierarchy had engendered powerful craft guilds 
and a new and increasingly powerful middle class.  &nbsp; <small>Photo by

<p>Formerly these merchants, brokers and craftsmen were held in low 
esteem by the nobility, existing only to serve their desires - but 
increasingly they now served their own desires, and moved to rein in the 
excesses of the nobility.</p>
<p>Humanism was on the rise, and remaining works of Greek and Roman art, 
architecture and literature, including some culinary works, were studied 
and discussed intensely. Europe began taking on a whole new appearance. 
Noble houses began to decline, slowly at first, then faster, pressured 
by the middle class from below and the ambition of kings from above.</p>
<p>This was also an era of exploration and commerce. European sailing 
ship technology became so sophisticated the entire world was now 
available for commerce and conquest.</p>

<p>The old spice trade monopolies were broken, with European monopolies 
taking their place, to be broken in turn. The cost of spices had begun 
it's precipitous decline. As they became affordable, their use in 
European cuisine plummeted - they were no longer an ostentatious 
display of wealth.</p>

<p>Food became much more diverse as new edibles were introduced from the 
New World: turkeys, potatoes, tomatoes, chilis, squash, chocolate; and 
from Asia: eggplants, oranges, lemons. Some took a while to be accepted 
because they were obviously relatives of the deadly nightshade, but 
European cuisines without them are unimaginable today.</p>

<p>During the Renaissance the use of forks continued to spread, from Italy 
into France and all over Europe, finally reaching England near the close 
of the period. The Medieval "great hall" was now a thing of legend - 
noble houses could no longer afford to maintain it and the people wouldn't 
put up with it. Dining became a much more private matter, but forks, 
spoons and knives were still brought to table by individual diners, 


<h3>Ascendency of French Cuisine</h3>

<p><img src="img/sv_snail01h.jpg" alt="Stuffed Snail Shells" class=mrg>
By 1712, with steam powered machinery already being deployed, Western 
culture was entering the early stages of a massive transformation that 
has yet to play out, its ultimate conclusion unknown to us. Wealth was 
starting to make a historic shift, from land owners and agricultural 
estates to industrialists, bankers, hoteliers and transportation moguls.
</p>
<p>By this time the cuisine of France had departed radically from the 
cuisines of England and Germany. France had imported many concepts, 
methods and exotic vegetables from Italy. Italy had imported many of 
them from Greece, and also from southern Spain where Roman influence 
still lingered. Formal French cuisine was now the very definition of 
sophisticated dining. 
&nbsp; <small>Photo &copy; <a href="https://www.clovegarden.com/photos.html#istock">i0142</a>
</small>.</p>

<p>It must be said though, that this famous cuisine was not that of the 
French people, nor of the provinces. It was an international standard 
established by talented French chefs for their own purposes. Even today 
true French cooking is highly regional, and normal households, then and 
now, have inadequate kitchen staff for the many hours of skimming and 
simmering needed to make the basic sauces of the "high cuisine". </p>

<p>In the great hotels, wealthy homes and royal courts French chefs were 
in great demand, from England to Russia. Meals were very elaborate and 
the courses were becoming strictly formalized. These chefs were, however, 
increasingly under pressure to cut costs. They abandoned the complex 
(and expensive) reductions of the past and invented flour thickened 
sauces and other features of economy.</p>

<p>Food was still served in the same manner, brought out in ordered 
courses in tureens and on platters to be taken as desired by the diners. 
Now, however, the dining rooms were much smaller, the diners of a single 
class, and items could be passed around the table so everyone could 
sample all dishes. This was the <i>service &acirc; la 
fran&ccedil;aise</i>, the European Service, what we call "Family Style" 
here in North America.</p>  

<p>On the table, though, some things were changing. By the mid 1700s sets 
of "silver" were provided by hosts as part of the standard table setting 
and guests no longer brought a little box with their own knife, fork and 
spoon. Pieces of silverware were often stolen by guests and servants 
alike - launching the new trade of "pattern matching", which continues 
to this day. In the mid 1700s the modern curved fork was invented in 
Germany and by the early 1800s four tines had become standard for dinner 
forks.</p> 

<p>A new etiquette was, of course, developing for display and use of 
this new tableware, and standards were established for table arrangement.
</p>

<p>Then came the French Revolution in 1789</p>


<h3>After the Revolution</h3>

<p><img src="img/frevol01e.jpg" alt="Guillotine" class=mrg>
<p>French nobility and royalty alike were shortened by about the length of 
one head, and the extensive wealth and properties of the Church were 
confiscated. Having run out of nobility, the revolutionaries then set 
about beheading each other, whole convents of nuns, and anyone else 
conveniently at hand. This nonsense ended suddenly with the execution of 
Robespierre in July 1794. Well, actually it didn't, just the former 
perpetrators became the targets.  &nbsp; <small>Illustration copyright 
expired.</small></p>

<p>Cooks who had served nobility, royalty and clergy were now unemployed. 
Simultaneous with this was the rapid rise to power of the middle class, 
now anxious to experience luxuries previously available only to the 
nobility.</p>
<p>The cooks, clever folks that they were, came up with a brand new 
concept - the restaurant. In the restaurants the middle class could enjoy 
the kind of dishes the nobility had enjoyed without the expense of 
employing a full time kitchen staff.</p>

<p>To enable them to serve a hundred different complex and tasty dishes 
quickly and to order, the cooks devised the world's first fast food 
system, now called the "French high cuisine". This system was organized 
and standardized by Marie-Antoine Car&ecirc;me, "King of Chefs and Chef 
of Kings". Four standard sauces were made in large quantity. As the main 
ingredient for an order was being cooked, a small amount of the appropriate 
sauce would be doped with special herbs, spices or other ingredients. When 
the main ingredient was done, it would be sent out to table with the 
appropriate sauce and a fancy name.</p>

<p>There was one big problem - the European service. It was very awkward 
in this restaurant setting. Dishes still took too long to prepare and were 
difficult to serve on small restaurant tables. Fortunately, some of the 
best cooks had served in the households of the Russian nobility. The 
Russian barbarians did things quite differently. They portioned food onto 
plates at a side board and presented them at table in individual portions. 
The separate courses were brought out and cleared one by one in this same 
manner.</p>

<p>The "Russian Service" (<i>Service &agrave; la Russe</i>) was an instant 
hit in the restaurant business and remains so today. It has even largely 
taken over in the private household, except for some special dinners such 
as Thanksgiving here in America.</p>

<p>During the 19th century the great hotels developed all over Europe and 
abroad to serve the travels of the moneyed class. These establishments 
hired the best chefs that money could buy, and "good hotel food" had a 
totally different connotation than it does today. These establishments 
followed the principles laid down by Car&ecirc;me and refined and 
codified by the great Escoffier in 1906. Little variation was allowed 
so the dining experience could be as expected no matter what country a 
traveler visited.</p>

<p>By he end of the 19th century the table setting in better restaurants 
and hotels had become formalized, and this practice was followed also in 
wealthy homes. It soon grew rather complex, with special utensils specific 
to certain dishes. About the only one of these still common in our era is 
the grapefruit spoon, but oyster forks still make an appearance here and 
there, and in France special tools for eating snails. Formal service 
also got out of hand, running to 14 courses.</p>

<h3>Modern Times</h3>

<p><img src="img/shuttle01k.jpg" alt="Space Shuttle" class=mrg>
Our era begins with the end of The Great War (World War I) in 1918. As 
the American Civil War was the last war of knighthood, valor displaced by 
industrial production, the Great War was the last war of kings. Not only 
were the noble houses of medieval times long gone, but the monarchies 
were now also gone or irrelevant. Even the opulent hotels where the likes 
of Escoffier had overseen the kitchens were declining, on their way to 
today's Holiday Inns. 
&nbsp; <small>Photo by NASA = Public Domain</small>.</p>

<p>The old order was dead - and World War II made very certain it stayed 
dead - but food habits tend to be extremely conservative. Food service 
expectations in both home and restaurants continued to follow the post 
revolution Russian service and the established order of courses. In 
restaurants this works so well that even Asian restaurants here in North 
America have partially adopted it. The formal 14 course dinner is, however, 
pretty much a ghost of the past.</p> 

<p>In the home, tradition hasn't been working so well. Unlike restaurants, 
few private homes have a staff of hard working Guatemalan illegals 
in the kitchen. This has resulted in sharply increased use of 
"convenience foods". Researchers have found these industrial concoctions, 
often of questionable nutritional value and safety, are used not so much 
to reduce total preparation effort as to enable serving more dishes at 
meals within the same time span.</p>

<p>Researchers suggest a better plan, particularly in view of the current 
epidemic of waistline expansion, diabetes and other health problems. This 
would be to get used to serving fewer items at a meal and pretty much 
skip most of the traditional courses, and the industrial stuff.</p>

<p>This is a plan I have long followed. Meals I serve consist of one 
carefully prepared and flavorful main dish (as often as not an Asian dish 
- this is  California, after all) served with rice, potatoes or pasta. It 
is accompanied only by a salad and wine. The salad may be served before, 
during or after the main dish, depending, or it may be a simple soup, 
depending on the main dish. I have yet to hear a complaint about this 
plan - fewer things but better things is a winner.</p>

<p>One modification I strongly recommend is replacement of the standard 
American dinner plate, which has become much too large, up to 11-1/4 
inches. This causes people to serve too much food, and load the plate 
with processed foods so it doesn't look empty. I prefer plates about 
8-1/4 inches diameter and a little deeper than the standard plate. This 
size works very well, unless you are serving large slabs of meat.</p>

<p>Another modification I recommend for the modern table is to become 
highly skilled with chopsticks. Not only can you show off at sushi bars, 
but these are the very best implements for eating regular dressed green 
salads. They are also perfect for disassembling fish on the plate and 
similar tasks requiring delicacy. At home, when serving Asian main dishes 
with rice, I just use a regular fork, much more efficient. One great 
thing about Southern California is we are free to adhere fanatically to 
tradition, or ignore it entirely, depending on the whim of the moment.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="asia">Asia</h2>

<p>Asian service differs significantly from Western service particularly 
in that the main dish is <u>always</u> rice, bread or noodles, depending 
on climatic region. Everything else is a side dish or topping to the main 
dish, and applied in modest servings. There will be as many of these 
side dishes, toppings and condiments as time and economic standing allows, 
and all are served at once. Diners may eat the ones they wish to in any 
order or amount that pleases them.</p>

<p>In some regions chopsticks and/or spoons are used. Knives are never 
present at the table. All food is cut into bite-size pieces in the kitchen 
before being served. Asians were much less tolerant of the concept of armed 
guests at the table than were the barbarians of the West.</p>

<h3>India</h3>

<p><img src="img/vcurry01e.jpg" alt="Loaded Thali" class=mrg>
Traditional dining in India is based on a 
rimmed metal tray called a <i>thali</i>. Each person at the table, which 
is very low and surrounded by thin cushions, has a thali about 13 to 14 
inches in diameter. Just inside the rim will be placed small metal bowls 
called <i>katori</i> which contain the various side dishes, dals, chutneys 
and the like. The center is reserved for bread or rice depending on 
climatic region - bread or rice in the north, rice in the south.

southeast, the regional Sona Masoori (a long grained rice), Seeraga Samba 
(a very tiny grained rice) or another local variety are preferred. 
In North America, Thai long grain aromatic rice will work fine for dishes 
from this region. Unlike most Asian countries, in India, particularly in 
the north, rice is often served as a pilaf or colored and decorated in 
various ways.</p>

<p>The only utensils are fingers and bread. Spoons are never present, 
except serving spoons. This accounts for the fact that soups were totally 
unknown in India until the arrival of Europeans, and are still little seen 
except in Europeanized environments. Now, in the 21st century, many 
restaurants in India serve soups, often with ceramic spoons imported 
from China.</p>

<p>All tableware is of metal as anything made of wood would have been 
burned for cooking heat, and manufacturing high fired ceramics requires 
too much fuel. India is more fuel poor than food poor, and that's saying 
something. Traditional kitchens cook over burning cow pies, and many of 
the poor today cook over burning plastic scraps - not real good for the 
environment.</p>
<p>Etiquette for using fingers and bread for conveying food to the mouth 
is, of course, well defined but varies with region. One rule is absolute. 
Once food is placed on a persons thali it may not be transferred to any 
other person, ever, with the sole exception of a mother conveying some 
to a babe in arms.</p>
<p>For large events, the thali is replaced by banana leaves with food 
spooned directly onto them, and metal cups are replaced by low fired clay 
single use cups. These are not washable and are discarded after the event.
</p>
<p>Many changes have been adopted from the time of the British Raj to the 
present. Lunches away from home are called <i>tiffin</i> from British 
slang. They are often prepared, packed and/or delivered by wives to 
husbands at work, and to children at school, in a stack of small metal 
trays also called <i>tiffin</i>.</p>
<p>In Mumbai (formerly Bombay), restaurants are impractical because 
of the mix of a dozen religions with differing food restrictions and 
ethnic groups with different preferences. A class of couriers called 
Tiffin Wallahs has developed a complex system for delivering many 
thousands of wife prepared tiffin stacks, still fresh and warm, to office 
bound men every day. This system has proved possible only in Mumbai 
because of its linear arrangement with a railroad from end to end.</p>
<p>Today, with the disappearance of servants and appearance of women 
working outside the home, food service is becoming simplified and 
Europeanized. Adoption of outsourcing work from the West and a Western 
style economy has made it necessary to adopt the form of food service 
that evolved with those structures. For informal dining, the thali and 
katori are often replaced by a stainless steel tray stamped with several 
compartments, a larger version of the paper and foam party plates used 
in North America. Today many in India sit down on chairs at a high table 
and eat a meal with a simplified array of side dishes and condiments - 
and some even use spoons and (gasp!) even forks.</p>
<p>This evolution can be seen here in Southern California as well. Not 
many years ago an Indian wife would not dare serve her husband chapatis 
(flat bread) not freshly made at that instant, for fear of derision, 
beating or divorce. Today markets serving Indian communities are well 
stocked with pre-made nan bread, chapatis and other roti. Those who still 
make them at home often use a tortilla press instead of traditional 
rolling, and whole wheat tortillas may stand in for harder to find 
chapatis (which they do very well, by the way).</p>


<h3>China</h3>

<p><img src="img/Chinese01.jpg" alt="Chinese Meal" class=mrg>
Today's China is a collection of distinct ethnic regions and languages 
scattered over a vast region. This is why China can not move to an 
alphabetic script, the symbolic characters represent the same things in 
many languages that cannot communicate with each other phonetically. The 
Communist government is trying to make the Han Chinese culture and the 
Mandarin dialect uniform and dominant over the whole, but is meeting 
considerable resistance.

<p>Naturally this vast region includes many cuisines, but there are some 
aspects of uniformity. One is the universal use of chopsticks (basically 
finger extensions) for conveying food from bowl to mouth, and total 
rejection of the fork of the barbarians. Spoons are used, but generally 
they are ceramic, not metal or wood.</p>
<p>Rice or noodles are always the main dishes with all else either side 
dishes or toppings. Bread is somewhat used in northern China but is not so 
traditional. Grinding wheat into flour was not possible in China until 
importation of stone mills from the Roman Empire, and is still considered 
a bit "foreign".</p>
<p>Rice is always served plain steamed. Dishes with added ingredients, like 
fried rice, are used as quick lunches or snacks, not as part of a normal 
sit-down meal. Rice varies regionally in China, with long grain common in 
the south and medium grain similar to Korean and Japanese in the north. 
Short grain sticky rice is used for deserts and the like.</p>
<p>As in the rest of Asia, all dishes are presented at table 
simultaneously - there are no courses. In contrast to India, soups and 
rice gruels are very popular in China, since they do have spoons there.
</p>
<p>Raw vegetables and salads are not served in China for reasons you'd 
probably rather not know.</p>

<h3>Japan</h3>

<p><img src="img/Japan01e.jpg" alt="Japanese Meal" class=mrg>
Through most of its history, Japan was "little China", importing its 
entire culture from the mainland (even though the Japanese and Chinese 
people aren't that closely related). This changed during the Kamakura 
Shogunate (1185 to 1333) when Japan was run by Zen Buddhist samurai. 
In this era, Japanese culture was refined and converted to the forms we 
know today.  &nbsp; <small>Photo by MichaelMaggs distributed under license

<p>Rice is generally the main course, with a medium grain rice being 
standard. This rice sticks together much more than long grain and can be 
handled more easily with pointy Japanese chopsticks. California grows 
large amounts of this sort of rice for export to Japan and Korea. Calrose 
is the best known variety, but I prefer Kokuho Rose.  As elsewhere, short 
grain sticky rice is reserved for deserts and the like.</p>
<p>Table service became simpler and more refined than the Chinese, but is 
basically similar. As in China and Korea, traditional seating is around a 
low table with all dishes on the table at the same time.</p>
<p>When Japan's imperial ambitions collided with the United States in the 
Pacific, the costly (to both sides) defeat and occupation by Americans 
changed traditional Japan very deeply. Today, older folks complain 
bitterly that young Japanese have lost the ability to use chopsticks, 
preferring Western forks, and the elegant cuisine is being replaced by a 
fast food culture.</p>
<p>This can be seen here in Southern California where the few remaining 
Japanese markets stock mostly convenience culture items for visitors and 
recent immigrants. Older immigrants have melded so thoroughly with 
American culture they no longer maintain a really separate identity. 
Little Tokyo in Los Angeles is in decline and now owned mainly by 
Koreans (as are most of the Japanese sushi bars here).</p>

<h3>Korea</h3>

<p><img src="img/Korea02h.jpg" alt="Korean meal" class=mrg>
Koreans are no closer related to the Chinese than the Japanese are, but 
whether the two peoples are any more closely related to each other has 
been debated inconclusively. Korean tastes and table service are, however, 
more akin to those of Japan than to those of China.   &nbsp; <small>Photo by

</p>
<p>Here in Los Angeles, if you want to prepare authentic Japanese cuisine, 
the best place to do your shopping is in the Korean markets. They are much 
better stocked with all the stuff you need than are the few remaining 
Japanese markets.</p>
<p>Korea does, however, present some serious differences from both its 
neighbors. Unlike China, where pork and chicken dominate, and Japan where 
fish dominates, the dominant meat in Korea is beef. Fish does, however, 
also play a major role in Korea.</p>
<p>Another major difference is the intense use of hot red chilis, not as 
hot as Thai chilis, but in quantities unthinkable in Japan or northern China. 
No Korean meal could possibly be complete without kimchi (pickled cabbage, 
radish, etc.) and by far the most popular kimchis are heavily laced with 
red chili.</p>
<p>Rice is always the main dish, and it is surrounded by a number of small 
side dishes (<i>banchan</i>). The number varies with economics, importance 
of a meal and other factors. At one time how many was decreed in accordance 
with social rank, with only royalty allowed nine. As in the rest of Asia 
all dishes are brought to the table at the same time.</p>
<p>Seating is around a low table and each person has their own rice bowl, 
as in China and Japan, but unlike those countries the bowl is never held 
in the hand while eating. Spoons are used for soup, and  often for rice as 
well, and chopsticks for everything else. Here the spoons and chopsticks are 
both made of metal, and often the bowls are too. It is never proper to use 
both spoon and chopsticks at the same time.</p>
<p>Starting to eat must begin with the oldest person at the table with 
the youngest person starting last. You should also cover your mouth if using 
a toothpick, but about the worst offence you can commit is to blow your nose 
at the table - it just isn't done.</p>
<p>Koreans have not adopted a fast food culture to anywhere near the extent 
in Japan, but some such items are used.  Many varieties of Korean packaged 
raman soups are displayed in any Korean market, and are, incidentally, way 
better than the Japanese - and a galaxy beyond those you find in supermarkets 
here. <br class=cll></p>

<h3>Thailand</h3>

<p><img src="img/Thai01e.jpg" alt="Thai Breakfast" class=mrg>
Thai cuisine is considered the high point of all of Southeast Asia. Here 
the palace cuisine and home cooking have been successfully blended. The 
main difference is that palace cuisine is presented with a great many 
decorations made of carved vegetables, herbs and other foods. Some Thai 
cookbooks have a chapter on creating these decorations, but here in North 
America all but the very simplest are simply ignored.</p>

<p>Rice is the main dish at every meal, in one form or another. This is 
long grain aromatic Thai Jasmine rice, except in parts of the northeast 
where Lao people dominate. Laos is the only country anywhere that uses 
short grain sticky rice as their main rice.</p>

<p>Very important in Thai cuisine are shrimp paste and the same fish sauces 
once so essential in the Roman Empire, and chilis - lots and lots of of very 
hot chilis. All these ingredients are used both in recipes and to make dips 
and condiments. Thai cuisine was hot even before chilis were brought from 
South America, by use of large amounts of black pepper and ginger. Some 
recipes are still done this way.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, though Thailand is the only Southeast Asian country 
never to come under European domination, it is the only one that has adopted 
the European fork - but they do use it wrong. They us the fork to load the 
spoon, the main utensil in Thailand (other than fingers) for carrying food 
to the mouth. Chopsticks are used, but only for dishes considered Chinese 
in origin. This includes all noodle dishes, whether there is a similar dish 
in China or not. &nbsp; <small>Photo by Mattes contributed to the public 
domain.</small>
<br class=cll></p>

<h3>Vietnam</h3>

<p><img src="img/Bunbo01e.jpg" alt="Bun Fo Hue" class=mrg>
Here Chinese and European influences are much stronger than in 
Thailand. The main religions are Chinese Buddhism (vs. Indian Buddhism 
in Thailand), Christianity, and Godless Communism. Chopsticks are
as greatly in evidence, as they are in China.   &nbsp; <small>Photo by

<p>Unlike China, however, raw vegetables and herbs are very much included  
 - Vietnamese cuisine is the most herb infested in the world. 
Even dill from northern Europe has been adopted enthusiastically.</p>
<p>Influence from the French occupation is much in evidence as well, 
with many sandwich style foods made up in (slightly modified) French 
bread. European style sit-down bistros and restaurants are quite evident, 
especially in the south.</p>
<p>Of course the Vietnamese also have spoons, and soups are very much 
in evidence everywhere. They are generally served with a plate of herbs 
and other ingredients to be added as desired. Whether the national soup 
of Vietnam, Pho, is of French origin or purely a local invention is much 
debated, but it is served all over Vietnam, from simple versions in the 
north to more sophisticated versions in the south. With a vast Vietnamese 
population settled here, it is also served all over Los Angeles and Orange 
counties in Southern California.</p>
<p>Overall, Vietnamese cuisine is very street food oriented, and even 
restaurant service shows that influence. A lot of food is served on 
skewers or in sandwiches. The most Vietnamese way of serving is to roll 
up various meats, herbs and vegetables in either a lettuce leaf or a 
sheet of rice paper (or even one inside the other with herbs between) 
and eat it with a dip. Fish sauce and shrimp paste are as much used as 
in Thailand, but chilis are used a little less intensely.</p>
<p>The Communists of Vietnam have recently proven to be rather ardent 
capitalists, but their culinary traditions meld more easily into this 
new reality than do those of some other regions.</p>

<h3>The Philippines</h3>

<p><img src="img/philipp01k.jpg" alt="Costumes" class=mrg>
This collection of uncountable islands is the crossroads of the 
Pacific region. The islands were originally populated by Negritos who 
may have crossed a land bridge from Indonesia. They were largely pushed 
aside by Austronesians, themselves driven from Taiwan by invading 
Chinese. There is still a small remnant population of Negritos - and 
a small remnant population of Austronesians in Taiwan. 
&nbsp; <small>Photo copyright expired</small>.</p>
<p>At various times the Philippines have been controlled by China, Spain, 
the United States, Japan, and the United States again. Today the Philippines 
are an independent nation.</p>
<p>This role as crossroads was particularly evident during World War II 
and the Japanese occupation. Naval battles, horribly damaging to both 
Japan and the United States, were fought in the Philippine seas, and land 
battles as well. 
Once the islands were lost to the U.S., Japan was cut off from it's fuel 
supplies in Southeast Asia, and the handwriting was on the wall.</p> 
<p>Of all Asia, the Philippines are the most Europeanized. Most of the 
population is Catholic or some other form of Christian. There are, 
however, enclaves of Muslims in the south, who are as violent and 
murderous as Muslims are anywhere else.<p>
<p>Foods from China, Spain, Mexico (through the Spanish), Japan and North 
America have all been adopted enthusiastically, and adapted (some may say 
"horribly distorted") to tastes and conditions of the Islands. Filipino 
food includes plenty of vinegar and various dried and fermented fish 
ingredients. Filipino shrimp paste is usually dyed with a strong color 
which dyes food a garish florescent purplish pink. I find this color 
rather unappetizing, so I use shrimp paste from somewhere else.</p>
<p>In general, Filipinos (Pinoy) have adopted the European method of 
serving and European table utensils. Here in Southern California we are 
becoming very familiar with Philippine cuisine because our entire health 
care system runs on Filipino immigrants - without them there would be no 
health care here. Filipino restaurants, however, are few an far between, 
because eating in the Philippines is very home based, supplemented by 
street vendors. There isn't a strong restaurant culture to produce chefs 
to open restaurants here in California.</p>

<h3>Indonesia</h3>
<p><img src="img/Indones01h.jpg" alt="Sundanese Meal" class=mrg>
Like the Philippines, Indonesia is a chain of uncountable islands, with 
culture and cuisine varying considerably from island to island. The 
country is almost entirely Muslim, except for the famous Hindu island of 
Bali. As you might expect, pig is not eaten except on Bali where it is 
very popular. &nbsp; <small>Photo by Gunawan Kartapranata, distributed

<p>Cuisine has been of little interest to Indonesians. There is no 
well defined "palace cuisine" as there is everywhere else in Asia, and 
there have never been famous chefs. Cooking has generally fallen to the 
lowest person on the family totem pole. With little incentive to do 
better, food is often poorly prepared from whatever is cheapest. There 
is no historic record and most Indonesian cookbooks have been written by 
interested foreigners or Indonesians abroad.</p>
<p>Internationally, Indonesian cuisine is known almost entirely for the 
<i>rijsttafel</i> (rice table) and <i>nasi goreng</i> (fried rice). As 
the name implies, the rijsttafel was an invention of the Dutch, very 
loosely based on Indonesian practice for large celebrations, and fried 
rice is from China.</p>
<p>Traditionally meals are taken on a raised platform covered with mats. 
Food is placed on platters and set out in the middle, where there may or may 
not be a low table.. The only eating utensils may be fingers, though 
spoons are also used. In some households forks appear, used in the Thai 
manner to load the spoon with only the spoon traveling to the mouth.<p>
<p>In the villages, food is often set out in the morning and remains 
there the entire day, then reheated in the evening. There are no set times 
for gathering to eat. For many, the standard meal is rice with some dried 
fish and chilis. Rice is preferred a bit sticky to make eating with fingers 
easier. It is always white rice, steamed or boiled, though for special 
occasions it may be dyed yellow.</p>
<p>A restaurant service unique to Indonesia is Padang style. A platter of 
rice is presented to the diner and small bowls containing every dish the 
restaurant serves are set out behind it. The diner takes those he or she 
wishes, and pays for only those. The rest go back to the pots in the 
kitchen. There is no menu and the patron doesn't know the cost until 
the bill is presented.</p>
<p>For the well-to-do in the cities, Dutch food became the norm, with local 
and regional food held in very low esteem. With the Dutch cuisine came 
tables, chairs, spoons and forks. Today American fast food is held in high 
esteem, with Japanese fast food a close second.</p>
<p>For those unable to afford KFC or Popeye's, street vendors are much in 
evidence. Most base their reputation on a single dish, sometimes the only 
dish they serve. Cooking food and supplying it to street vendors is a minor 
industry among housewives.</p>
<p>Despite this seemingly unpromising environment, writers and persons 
concerned with preserving the older cultures have scoured the islands and 
written books recording many recipes very much worthy of our attention.</p>
